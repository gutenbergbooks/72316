<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>THE LOMBARD STREET DEPOSIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. William Spedding</span>, of the firm of Spedding,
Mortimer and Larach, Solicitors, bought
the site in Lombard Street in the conventional
way. The property came into the market on the
death of an old lady who lived at Market Harborough,
who has nothing to do with this story,
and it was put up to auction in the orthodox
fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. William Spedding secured the site at £106,000,
a sum sufficiently large to excite the interest
of all the evening papers and a great number of
the morning journals as well.</p>

<p>As a matter of exact detail, I may add that
plans were produced and approved by the city
surveyor for the erection of a building of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
peculiar type. The city surveyor was a little puzzled
by the interior arrangement of the new edifice,
but as it fulfilled all the requirements of the
regulations governing buildings in the City of
London, and no fault could be found either with
the external appearance—its façade had been so
artfully designed that you might pass a dozen
times a day without the thought occurring that
this new building was anything out of the common
ruck—and as the systems of ventilation and
light were beyond reproach, he passed the plans
with a shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand, Mr. Spedding,” he said,
laying his forefinger on the blue print, “how your
client intends securing privacy. There is a lobby
and one big hall. Where are the private offices,
and what is the idea of this huge safe in the middle
of the hall, and where are the clerks to sit? I
suppose he will have clerks? Why, man, he
won’t have a minute’s peace!”</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“He will have all the peace he wants,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>“And the vaults—I should have thought that
vaults would be the very thing you wanted for
this.” He tapped the corner of the sheet where
was inscribed decorously: “Plan for the erection
of a New Safe Deposit.”</p>

<p>“There is the safe,” said Mr. Spedding, and
smiled again.</p>

<p>This William Spedding, now unhappily no
longer with us—he died suddenly, as I will relate—was
a large, smooth man with a suave manner.
He smoked good cigars, the ends of which he
snipped off with a gold cigar-cutter, and his smile
came readily, as from a man who had no fault
to find with life.</p>

<p>To continue the possibly unnecessary details, I
may add further that whilst tenders were requested
for the erection of the New Safe Deposit,
the provision of the advertisement that the lowest
tender would not necessarily be accepted was
justified by the fact that the offer of Potham and
Holloway was approved, and it is an open secret
that their tender was the highest of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>“My client requires the very best work; he
desires a building that will stand shocks.” Mr.
Spedding shot a swift glance at the contractor,
who sat at the other side of the desk. “Something
that a footling little dynamite explosion
would not scatter to the four winds.”</p>

<p>The contractor nodded.</p>

<p>“You have read the specification,” the solicitor
went on—he was cutting a new cigar, “and in
regard to the pedestal—ah—the pedestal, you
know——?”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at the contractor.</p>

<p>“It seems all very clear,” said the great builder.
He took a bundle of papers from an open bag by
his side and read, “The foundation to be of concrete
to the depth of twenty feet.... The
pedestal to be alternate layers of dressed granite
and steel ... in the center a steel-lined
compartment, ten inches by five, and half the
depth of the pedestal itself.”</p>

<p>The solicitor inclined his head.</p>

<p>“That pedestal is to be the most important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
thing in the whole structure. The steel-lined recess—I
don’t know the technical phrase—which
one of these days your men will have to fill in, is
the second most important; but the safe that is to
stand fifty feet above the floor of the building is
to be—but the safe is arranged for.”</p>

<p>An army of workmen, if the hackneyed phrase
be permitted, descended upon Lombard Street and
pulled down the old buildings. They pulled them
down, and broke them down, and levered them
down, and Lombard Street grew gray with dust.
The interiors of quaint old rooms with grimy oak
paneling were indecently exposed to a passing
public. Clumsy, earthy carts blocked Lombard
Street, and by night flaring Wells’ lights roared
amidst the chaos.</p>

<p>And bare-armed men sweated and delved by
night and by day; and one morning Mr. Spedding
stood in a drizzle of rain, with a silk umbrella
over his head, and expressed, on behalf of his
client, his intense satisfaction at the progress
made. He stood on a slippery plank that formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
a barrow road, and workmen, roused to unusual
activity by the presence of “The Firm”—Mr.
Spedding’s cicerone—moved to and fro at a
feverish rate of speed.</p>

<p>“They don’t mind the rain,” said the lawyer,
sticking out his chin in the direction of the toiling
gangs.</p>

<p>“The Firm” shook his head.</p>

<p>“Extra pay,” he said laconically, “we provided
for that in the tender,” he hastened to add in
justification of his munificence.</p>

<p>So in rain and sunshine, by day and by night,
the New Safe Deposit came into existence.</p>

<p>Once—it was during a night shift, a brougham
drove up the deserted city street, and a footman
helped from the dark interior of the carriage a
shivering old man with a white, drawn face. He
showed a written order to the foreman, and
was allowed inside the unpainted gate of the
“works.”</p>

<p>He walked gingerly amidst the debris of construction,
asked no questions, made no replies to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
the explanations of the bewildered foreman, who
wondered what fascination there was in a building
job to bring an old man from his bed at three
o’clock on a chill spring morning.</p>

<p>Only once the old man spoke.</p>

<p>“Where will that there pedestal be?” he asked
in a harsh, cracked cockney voice; and when the
foreman pointed out the spot, and the men even
then busily filling in the foundation, the old man’s
lips curled back in an ugly smile that showed
teeth too white and regular for a man of his age.
He said no more, but pulled the collar of his fur
coat the tighter about his lean neck and walked
wearily back to his carriage.</p>

<p>The building saw Mr. Spedding’s client no
more—if, indeed, it was Mr. Spedding’s client.
So far as is known, he did not again visit Lombard
Street before its completion—even when
the last pane of glass had been fixed in the high
gilded dome, when the last slab of marble had
been placed in the ornate walls of the great hall,
even when the solicitor came and stood in silent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
contemplation before the great granite pedestal
that rose amidst a scaffolding of slim steel girders
supporting a staircase that wound upward to the
gigantic mid-air safe.</p>

<p>Not quite alone, for with him was the contractor,
awed to silence by the immensity of his
creation.</p>

<p>“Finished!” said the contractor, and his voice
came echoing back from the dim spaces of the
building.</p>

<p>The solicitor did not answer.</p>

<p>“Your client may commence business to-morrow
if he wishes.”</p>

<p>The solicitor turned from the pedestal.</p>

<p>“He is not ready yet,” he said softly, as
though afraid of the echoes.</p>

<p>He walked to where the big steel doors of the
hall stood ajar, the contractor following.</p>

<p>In the vestibule he took two keys from his
pocket. The heavy doors swung noiselessly
across the entrance, and Mr. Spedding locked
them. Through the vestibule and out into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
busy street the two men walked, and the solicitor
fastened behind him the outer doors.</p>

<p>“My client asks me to convey his thanks to
you for your expedition,” the lawyer said.</p>

<p>The builder rubbed his hands with some satisfaction.</p>

<p>“You have taken two days less than we expected,”
Mr. Spedding went on.</p>

<p>The builder was a man of few ideas outside his
trade. He said again—</p>

<p>“Yes, your client may start business to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The solicitor smiled.</p>

<p>“My client, Mr. Potham, may not—er—start
business—for ten years,” he said. “In fact,
until—well, until he dies, Mr. Potham.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>THE HOUSE IN TERRINGTON SQUARE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> turned into Terrington Square from
Seymour Street and walked leisurely past the
policeman on point duty, bidding him a curt
“good night.” The officer subsequently described
the passer, as a foreign-looking gentleman with a
short pointed beard. Under the light overcoat
he was apparently in evening dress, for the officer
observed the shoes with the plain black bow, and
the white silk muffler and the crush hat supported
that view. The man crossed the road, and disappeared
round the corner of the railed garden
that forms the center of the square. A belated
hansom came jingling past, and an early newspaper
cart, taking a short cut to Paddington, followed;
then the square was deserted save for the
man and the policeman.</p>

<p>The grim, oppressive houses of the square were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
wrapped in sleep—drawn blinds and shuttered
windows and silence.</p>

<p>The man continued his stroll until he came
abreast of No. 43. Here he stopped for a second,
gave one swift glance up and down the thoroughfare,
and mounted the three steps of the
house. He fumbled a little with the key, turned
it, and entered. Inside he stood for a moment,
then taking a small electric lamp from his pocket
he switched on the current.</p>

<p>He did not trouble to survey the wide entrance
hall, but flashed the tiny beam of light on the inside
face of the door. Two thin wires and a
small coil fastened to the lintel called forth no
comment. One of the wires had been snapped by
the opening of the door.</p>

<p>“Burglar-alarm, of course,” he murmured approvingly.
“All the windows similarly treated,
and goodness knows what pitfalls waiting for the
unwary.”</p>

<p>He flashed the lamp round the hall. A heavy
Turkish rug at the foot of the winding staircase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
secured his attention. He took from his pocket
a telescopic stick, extended it, and fixed it rigid.
Then he walked carefully towards the rug. With
his stick he lifted the corner, and what he saw
evidently satisfied him, for he returned to the
door, where in a recess stood a small marble
statue. All his strength was required to lift this,
but he staggered back with it, and rolling it on its
circular base, as railway porters roll milk churns,
he brought it to the edge of the rug. With a
quick push he planted it square in the center of
the carpet. For a second only it stood, oscillating,
then like a flash it disappeared, and where
the carpet had lain was a black, gaping hole. He
waited. Somewhere from the depths came a
crash, and the carpet came slowly up again and
filled the space. The unperturbed visitor nodded
his head, as though again approving the householder’s
caution.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose he has learnt any new ones,”
he murmured regretfully, “he is getting very
old.” He took stock of the walls. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
covered with paintings and engravings. “He
could not have fixed the cross fire in a modern
house,” he continued, and taking a little run, leapt
the rug and rested for a moment on the bottom
stair. A suit of half armor on the first landing
held him in thoughtful attention for a moment.
“Elizabethan body, with a Spanish bayonet,” he
said regretfully; “that doesn’t look like a collector’s
masterpiece.” He flashed the lamp up
and down the silent figure that stood in menacing
attitude with a raised battle-ax. “I don’t like
that ax,” he murmured, and measured the distance.</p>

<p>Then he saw the fine wire that stretched across
the landing. He stepped across carefully, and
ranged himself alongside the steel knight. Slipping
off his coat, he reached up and caught the
figure by the wrist. Then with a quick jerk of
his foot he snapped the wire.</p>

<p>He had been prepared for the mechanical
downfall of the ax; but as the wire broke the
figure turned to the right, and swish! came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
ax in a semicircular cut. He had thought to
hold the arm as it descended, but he might as well
have tried to hold the piston-rod of an engine.
His hand was wrenched away, and the razor-like
blade of the ax missed his head by the fraction of
a second. Then with a whir the arm rose stiffly
again to its original position and remained rigid.</p>

<p>The visitor moistened his lips and sighed.</p>

<p>“That’s a new one, a very new one,” he said
under his breath, and the admiration in his tone
was evident. He picked up his overcoat, flung
it over his arm, and mounted half a dozen steps
to the next landing. The inspection of the
Chinese cabinet was satisfactory.</p>

<p>The white beam of his lamp flashed into corners
and crevices and showed nothing. He shook the
curtain of a window and listened, holding his
breath.</p>

<p>“Not here,” he muttered decisively, “the old
man wouldn’t try <i>that</i> game. Snakes turned
loose in a house in London, S.W., take a deal of
collecting in the morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>He looked round. From the landing access
was gained to three rooms. That which from its
position he surmised faced the street he did not
attempt to enter. The second, covered by a heavy
curtain, he looked at for a time in thought. To
the third he walked, and carefully swathing the
door-handle with his silk muffler, he turned it.
The door yielded. He hesitated another moment,
and jerking the door wide open, sprang backward.</p>

<p>The interior of the room was for a second only
in pitch darkness, save for the flicker of light that
told of an open fireplace. Then the visitor heard
a click, and the room was flooded with light. In
the darkness on the landing the man waited; then
a voice, a cracked old voice, said grumblingly—</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>Still the man on the landing waited.</p>

<p>“Oh, come in, Jimmy—I know ye.”</p>

<p>Cautiously the man outside stepped through the
entry into the light and faced the old man, who,
arrayed in a wadded dressing-gown, sat in a big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
chair by the fire—an old man, with white face and
a sneering grin, who sat with his lap full of
papers.</p>

<p>The visitor nodded a friendly greeting.</p>

<p>“As far as I can gather,” he said deliberately,
“we are just above your dressing-room, and if
you dropped me through one of your patent traps,
Reale, I should fetch up amongst your priceless
china.”</p>

<p>Save for a momentary look of alarm on the old
man’s face at the mention of the china, he preserved
an imperturbable calm, never moving his
eyes from his visitor’s face. Then his grin returned,
and he motioned the other to a chair on
the other side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Jimmy turned the cushion over with the point
of his stick and sat down.</p>

<p>“Suspicious?”—the grin broadened—“suspicious
of your old friend, Jimmy? The old
governor, eh?”</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply for a moment, then—</p>

<p>“You’re a wonder, governor, upon my word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
you are a wonder. That man in armor—your
idea?”</p>

<p>The old man shook his head regretfully.</p>

<p>“Not mine entirely, Jimmy. Ye see, there’s
electricity in it, and I don’t know much about
electricity. I never did, except——”</p>

<p>“Except?” suggested the visitor.</p>

<p>“Oh, that roulette board, that was my own
idea; but that was magnetism, which is different
to electricity, by my way of looking.”</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

<p>“Ye got past the trap?” The old man had
just a glint of admiration in his eye.</p>

<p>“Yes, jumped it.”</p>

<p>The old man nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“You always was a one for thinkin’ things out.
I’ve known lots of ’em who would never have
thought of jumping it. Connor, and that pig
Massey, they’d have walked right on to it. You
didn’t damage anything?” he demanded suddenly
and fiercely. “I heard somethin’ break,
an’ I was hoping that it was you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Jimmy thought of the marble statue, and remembered
that it had looked valuable.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” he lied easily, and the old
man’s tense look relaxed.</p>

<p>The pair sat on opposite sides of the fireplace,
neither speaking for fully ten minutes; then
Jimmy leant forward.</p>

<p>“Reale,” he said quietly, “how much are you
worth?”</p>

<p>In no manner disturbed by this leading question,
but rather indicating a lively satisfaction, the
other replied instantly—</p>

<p>“Two millions an’ a bit over, Jimmy. I’ve got
the figures in my head. Reckonin’ furniture and
the things in this house at their proper value, two
millions, and forty-seven thousand and forty-three
pounds—floatin’, Jimmy, absolute cash, the
same as you might put your hand in your pocket
an’ spend—a million an’ three-quarters exact.”</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair with a triumphant
grin and watched his visitor.</p>

<p>Jimmy had taken a cigarette from his pocket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
and was lighting it, looking at the slowly burning
match reflectively.</p>

<p>“A million and three-quarters,” he repeated
calmly, “is a lot of money.”</p>

<p>Old Reale chuckled softly.</p>

<p>“All made out of the confiding public, with the
aid of me—and Connor and Massey——”</p>

<p>“Massey is a pig!” the old man interjected
spitefully.</p>

<p>Jimmy puffed a cloud of tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>“Wrung with sweat and sorrow from foolish
young men who backed the tiger and played high
at Reale’s Unrivaled Temple of Chance, Cairo,
Egypt—with branches at Alexandria, Port Said,
and Suez.”</p>

<p>The figure in the wadded gown writhed in a
paroxysm of silent merriment.</p>

<p>“How many men have you ruined, Reale?”
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“The Lord knows!” the old man answered
cheerfully; “only three as I knows of—two of
’em’s dead, one of ’em’s dying. The two that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
dead left neither chick nor child; the dying one’s
got a daughter.”</p>

<p>Jimmy eyed him through narrowed lids.</p>

<p>“Why this solicitude for the relatives—you’re
not going——?”</p>

<p>As he spoke, as if anticipating a question, the
old man was nodding his head with feverish
energy, and all the while his grin broadened.</p>

<p>“What a one you are for long words, Jimmy!
You always was. That’s how you managed to
persuade your swell pals to come an’ try their
luck. Solicitude! What’s that mean? Frettin’
about ’em, d’ye mean? Yes, that’s what I’m doin’—frettin’
about ’em. And I’m going to make,
what d’ye call it—you had it on the tip of your
tongue a minute or two ago?”</p>

<p>“Reparation?” suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>Old Reale nodded delightedly.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you ask questions!” bullied the old
man, his harsh voice rising. “I ain’t asked you
why you broke into my house in the middle of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the night, though I knew it was you who came
the other day to check the electric meter. I
saw you, an’ I’ve been waitin’ for you ever
since.”</p>

<p>“I knew all about that,” said Jimmy calmly,
and flicked the ash of his cigarette away
with his little finger, “and I thought you
would——”</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped speaking and listened.</p>

<p>“Who’s in the house beside us?” he asked
quickly, but the look on the old man’s face reassured
him.</p>

<p>“Nobody,” said Reale testily. “I’ve got a
special house for the servants, and they come in
every morning after I’ve unfixed my—burglar-alarms.”
He grinned, and then a look of alarm
came into his face.</p>

<p>“The alarms!” he whispered; “you broke
them when you came in, Jimmy. I heard the
signal. If there’s some one in the house we
shouldn’t know it now.”</p>

<p>They listened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Down below in the hall something creaked,
then the sound of a soft thud came up.</p>

<p>“He’s skipped the rug,” whispered Jimmy, and
switched out the light.</p>

<p>The two men heard a stealthy footstep on the
stair, and waited. There was the momentary
glint of a light, and the sound of some one breathing
heavily. Jimmy leant over and whispered in
the old man’s ear.</p>

<p>Then, as the handle of the door was turned and
the door pushed open, Jimmy switched on the
light.</p>

<p>The newcomer was a short, thick-set man with
a broad, red face. He wore a check suit of a
particularly glaring pattern, and on the back of
his head was stuck a bowler hat, the narrow brim
of which seemed to emphasize the breadth of his
face. A casual observer might have placed him
for a coarse, good-natured man of rude but boisterous
humor. The ethnological student would
have known him at once for what he was—a cruel
man-beast without capacity for pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>He started back as the lights went on, blinking
a little, but his hand held an automatic pistol that
covered the occupants of the room.</p>

<p>“Put up your hands,” he growled. “Put ’em
up!”</p>

<p>Neither man obeyed him. Jimmy was amused
and looked it, stroking his short beard with his
white tapering fingers. The old man was fury
incarnate.</p>

<p>He it was that turned to Jimmy and croaked—</p>

<p>“What did I tell ye, Jimmy? What’ve I always
said, Jimmy? Massey is a pig—he’s got
the manners of a pig. Faugh!”</p>

<p>“Put up your hands!” hissed the man with
the pistol. “Put ’em up, or I’ll put you both
out!”</p>

<p>“If he’d come first, Jimmy!” Old Reale
wrung his hands in his regret. “S’pose he’d
jumped the rug—any sneak-thief could have done
that—d’ye think he’d have spotted the man in
armor? If you’d only get the man in armor
ready again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>“Put your pistol down, Massey,” said Jimmy
coolly, “unless you want something to play with.
Old man Reale’s too ill for the gymnastics you
suggest, and I’m not inclined to oblige you.”</p>

<p>The man blustered.</p>

<p>“By God, if you try any of your monkey tricks
with me, either of you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m only a visitor like yourself,” said
Jimmy, with a wave of his hand; “and as to
monkey tricks, why, I could have shot you before
you entered the room.”</p>

<p>Massey frowned, and stood twiddling his pistol.</p>

<p>“You will find a safety catch on the left side of
the barrel,” continued Jimmy, pointing to the
pistol; “snick it up—you can always push it down
again with your thumb if you really mean business.
You are not my idea of a burglar. You
breathe too noisily, and you are built too clumsily;
why, I heard you open the front door!”</p>

<p>The quiet contempt in the tone brought a
deeper red into the man’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a clever ’un, we know!” he began,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
and the old man, who had recovered his self-command,
motioned him to a chair.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mister Massey,” he snapped; “sit
down, my fine fellow, an’ tell us all the news.
Jimmy an’ me was just speakin’ about you, me an’
Jimmy was. We was saying what a fine gentleman
you was”—his voice grew shrill—“what a
swine, what an overfed, lumbering fool of a pig
you was, Mister Massey!”</p>

<p>He sank back into the depths of his chair exhausted.</p>

<p>“Look here, governor,” began Massey again—he
had laid his pistol on a table by his side, and
waved a large red hand to give point to his remarks—“we
don’t want any unpleasantness.
I’ve been a good friend to you, an’ so has Jimmy.
We’ve done your dirty work for years, me an’
Jimmy have, and Jimmy knows it”—turning
with an ingratiating smirk to the subject of his
remarks—“and now we want a bit of our own—that
is all it amounts to, our own.”</p>

<p>Old Reale looked under his shaggy eyebrows to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
where Jimmy sat with brooding eyes watching the
fire.</p>

<p>“So it’s a plant, eh? You’re both in it.
Jimmy comes first, he being the clever one, an’
puts the lay nice an’ snug for the other feller.”</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Wrong,” he said. He turned his head and
took a long scrutiny of the newcomer, and the
amused contempt of his gaze was too apparent.</p>

<p>“Look at him!” he said at last. “Our dear
Massey! Does he look the sort of person I am
likely to share confidence with?”</p>

<p>A cold passion seemed suddenly to possess him.</p>

<p>“It’s a coincidence that brought us both together.”</p>

<p>He rose and walked to where Massey sat, and
stared down at him. There was something in the
look that sent Massey’s hand wandering to his
pistol.</p>

<p>“Massey, you dog!” he began, then checked
himself with a laugh and walked to the other end
of the room. There was a tantalus with a soda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
siphon, and he poured himself a stiff portion and
sent the soda fizzling into the tumbler. He held
the glass to the light and looked at the old man.
There was a look on the old man’s face that he
remembered to have seen before. He drank his
whisky and gave utterance to old Reale’s thoughts.</p>

<p>“It’s no good, Reale, you’ve got to settle with
Massey, but not the way you’re thinking. We
could put him away, but we should have to put
ourselves away too.” He paused. “And there’s
me,” he added.</p>

<p>“And Connor,” said Massey thickly, “and
Connor’s worse than me. I’m reasonable, Reale;
I’d take a fair share——”</p>

<p>“You would, would you?”</p>

<p>The old man was grinning again.</p>

<p>“Well, your share’s exactly a million an’ three-quarters
in solid cash, an’ a bit over two millions—all
in.”</p>

<p>He paused to notice the effect of his words.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s calm annoyed him; Massey’s indifference
was outrageous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“An’ it’s Jimmy’s share, an’ Connor’s share,
an’ it’s Miss Kathleen Kent’s share.”</p>

<p>This time the effect was better. Into
Jimmy’s inexpressive face had crept a gleam of
interest.</p>

<p>“Kent?” he asked quickly. “Wasn’t that the
name of the man——?”</p>

<p>Old Reale chuckled.</p>

<p>“The very feller, Jimmy—the man who came
in to lose a tenner, an’ lost ten thousand; who
came in next night to get it back, and left his lot.
That’s the feller!”</p>

<p>He rubbed his lean hands, as at the memory of
some pleasant happening.</p>

<p>“Open that cupboard, Jimmy.” He pointed to
an old-fashioned walnut cabinet that stood near
the door. “D’ye see anything—a thing that looks
like a windmill?”</p>

<p>Jimmy drew out a cardboard structure that was
apparently a toy working-model. He handled it
carefully, and deposited it on the table by the old
man’s side. Old Reale touched it caressingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
With his little finger he set a fly-wheel spinning,
and tiny little pasteboard rods ran to and fro, and
little wooden wheels spun easily.</p>

<p>“That’s what I did with <i>his</i> money, invented a
noo machine that went by itself—perpetual motion.
You can grin, Massey, but that’s what I
did with it. Five years’ work an’ a quarter of a
million, that’s what that little model means. I
never found the secret out. I could always make
a machine that would go for hours with a little
push, but it always wanted the push. I’ve been
a chap that went in for inventions and puzzles.
D’ye remember the table at Suez?”</p>

<p>He shot a sly glance at the men.</p>

<p>Massey was growing impatient as the reminiscences
proceeded. He had come that night with
an object; he had taken a big risk, and had not
lost sight of the fact. Now he broke in—</p>

<p>“Damn your puzzles, Reale. What about me;
never mind about Jimmy. What’s all this rotten
talk about two millions for each of us, and this
girl? When you broke up the place in Egypt you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
said we should stand in when the time came.
Well, the time’s come!”</p>

<p>“Nearly, nearly,” said Reale, with his death’s-head
grin. “It’s nearly come. You needn’t
have troubled to see me. My lawyer’s got your
addresses. I’m nearly through,” he went on
cheerfully; “dead I’ll be in six months, as sure
as—as death. Then you fellers will get the
money”—he spoke slowly to give effect to his
words—“you Jimmy, <i>or</i> Massey or Connor <i>or</i>
the young lady. You say you don’t like puzzles,
Massey? Well, it’s a bad look out for you.
Jimmy’s the clever un, an’ most likely he’ll get it;
Connor’s artful, and he might get it from Jimmy;
but the young lady’s got the best chance, because
women are good at puzzles.”</p>

<p>“What in hell!” roared Massey, springing to
his feet.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” It was Jimmy that spoke, and
Massey obeyed.</p>

<p>“There’s a puzzle about these two millions,”
Reale went on, and his croaky voice, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
harsh cockney accent, grew raucous in his enjoyment
of Massey’s perplexity and Jimmy’s knit
brows. “An’ the one that finds the puzzle out,
gets the money.”</p>

<p>Had he been less engrossed in his own amusement
he would have seen a change in Massey’s
brute face that would have warned him.</p>

<p>“It’s in my will,” he went on. “I’m goin’ to
set the sharps against the flats; the touts of the
gamblin’ hell—that’s you two fellers—against the
pigeons. Two of the biggest pigeons is dead, an’
one’s dying. Well, he’s got a daughter; let’s see
what <i>she</i> can do. When I’m dead——”</p>

<p>“That’s now!” bellowed Massey, and leant
over and struck the old man.</p>

<p>Jimmy, on his feet, saw the gush of blood and
the knife in Massey’s hand, and reached for his
pocket.</p>

<p>Massey’s pistol covered him, and the man’s face
was a dreadful thing to look upon.</p>

<p>“Hands up! It’s God’s truth I’ll kill you if
you don’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Jimmy’s hands went up.</p>

<p>“He’s got the money here,” breathed Massey,
“somewhere in this house.”</p>

<p>“You’re mad,” said the other contemptuously.
“Why did you hit him?”</p>

<p>“He sat there makin’ a fool of me.” The
murderer gave a vicious glance at the inert figure
on the floor. “I want something more than his
puzzle-talk. He asked for it.”</p>

<p>He backed to the table where the decanter
stood, and drank a tumbler half-filled with raw
spirit.</p>

<p>“We’re both in this, Jimmy,” he said, still
keeping his man covered. “You can put down
your hands; no monkey tricks. Give me your
pistol.”</p>

<p>Jimmy slipped the weapon from his pocket, and
handed it butt foremost to the man. Then Massey
bent over the fallen man and searched his
pockets.</p>

<p>“Here are the keys. You stay here,” said
Massey, and went out, closing the door after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Jimmy heard the grate of the key, and knew
he was a prisoner. He bent over the old man.
He lay motionless. Jimmy tried the pulse, and
felt a faint flutter. Through the clenched teeth
he forced a little whisky, and after a minute the
old man’s eyes opened.</p>

<p>“Jimmy!” he whispered; then remembering,
“Where’s Massey?” he asked.</p>

<p>There was no need to inquire the whereabouts
of Massey. His blundering footfalls sounded in
the room above.</p>

<p>“Lookin’ for money?” gasped the old man,
and something like a smile crossed his face.
“Safe’s up there,” he whispered, and smiled
again. “Got the keys?”</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

<p>The old man’s eyes wandered round the room
till they rested on what looked like a switchboard.</p>

<p>“See that handle marked ‘seven’?” he whispered.</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded again.</p>

<p>“Pull it down, Jimmy boy.” His voice was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
growing fainter. “This is a new one that I read
in a book. Pull it down.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Do as I tell you,” the lips motioned, and
Jimmy walked across the room and pulled over
the insulated lever.</p>

<p>As he did there was a heavy thud overhead that
shook the room, and then silence.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The dying man smiled.</p>

<p>“That’s Massey!” said the lips.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Half an hour later Jimmy left the house with
a soiled slip of paper in his waistcoat pocket, on
which was written the most precious verse of doggerel
that the world has known.</p>

<p>And the discovery of the two dead men in the
upper chambers the next morning afforded the
evening press the sensation of the year.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>ANGEL ESQUIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Nobody</span> quite knows how Angel Esquire came
to occupy the position he does at Scotland Yard.
On his appointment, “An Officer of Twenty
Years’ Standing” wrote to the <i>Police Review</i> and
characterized the whole thing as “a job.” Probably
it was. For Angel Esquire had been many
things in his short but useful career, but never a
policeman. He had been a big game shot, a
special correspondent, a “scratch” magistrate,
and his nearest approach to occupying a responsible
position in any police force in the world was
when he was appointed a J.P. of Rhodesia, and,
serving on the Tuli Commission, he hanged
M’Linchwe and six of that black desperado’s companions.</p>

<p>His circle of acquaintances extended to the
suburbs of London, and the suburbanites, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
love you to make their flesh creep, would sit in
shivering but pleasurable horror whilst Angel
Esquire elaborated the story of the execution.</p>

<p>In Mayfair Angel Esquire was best known as
a successful mediator.</p>

<p>“Who is that old-looking young man with the
wicked eye?” asked the Dowager Duchess of
Hoeburn; and her <i>vis-à-vis</i> at the Honorable Mrs.
Carter-Walker’s “sit-down tea”—it was in the
days when Mayfair was aping suburbia—put up
his altogether unnecessary eyeglass.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Angel Esquire!” he said carelessly.</p>

<p>“What is he?” asked the Duchess.</p>

<p>“A policeman.”</p>

<p>“India?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>“Good Heavens!” said Her Grace in a
shocked voice. “How very dreadful! What is
he doing? Watching the guests, or keeping a
friendly eye on the Carter woman’s spoons?”</p>

<p>The young man guffawed.</p>

<p>“Don’t despise old Angel, Duchess,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“He’s a man to know. Great fellow for putting
things right. If you have a row with your governor,
or get into the hands of—er—undesirables,
or generally, if you’re in a mess of any kind,
Angel’s the chap to pull you out.”</p>

<p>Her Grace surveyed the admirable man with a
new interest.</p>

<p>Angel Esquire, with a cup of tea in one hand
and a thin grass sandwich in the other, was the
center of a group of men, including the husband
of the hostess. He was talking with some animation.</p>

<p>“I held three aces pat, and opened the pot light
to let ’em in. Young Saville raised the opening
to a tenner, and the dealer went ten better.
George Manfred, who had passed, came in for a
pony, and took one card. I took two, and drew
another ace. Saville took one, and the dealer
stood pat. I thought it was my money, and bet
a pony. Saville raised it to fifty, the dealer made
it a hundred, and George Manfred doubled the
bet. It was up to me. I had four aces; I put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Saville with a ‘full,’ and the dealer with a
‘flush.’ I had the beating of that lot; but what
about Manfred? Manfred is a feller with all the
sense going. He knew what the others had. If
he bet, he had the goods, so I chucked my four
aces into the discard. George had a straight
flush.”</p>

<p>A chorus of approval came from the group.</p>

<p>If “An Officer of Twenty Years’ Standing”
had been a listener, he might well have been further
strengthened in his opinion that of all persons
Mr. Angel was least fitted to fill the responsible
position he did.</p>

<p>If the truth be told, nobody quite knew exactly
what position Angel did hold. If you turn into
New Scotland Yard and ask the janitor at the
door for Mr. Christopher Angel—Angel Esquire
by the way was a nickname affixed by a pert little
girl—the constable, having satisfied himself as to
your <i>bona-fides</i>, would take you up a flight of
stairs and hand you over to yet another officer,
who would conduct you through innumerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
swing doors, and along uncounted corridors till
he stopped before a portal inscribed “647.”
Within, you would find Angel Esquire sitting at
his desk, doing nothing, with the aid of a <i>Sporting
Life</i> and a small weekly guide to the
Turf.</p>

<p>Once Mr. Commissioner himself walked into
the room unannounced, and found Angel so immersed
in an elaborate calculation, with big sheets
of paper closely filled with figures, and open books
on either hand, that he did not hear his visitor.</p>

<p>“What is the problem?” asked Mr. Commissioner,
and Angel looked up with his sweetest
smile, and recognizing his visitor, rose.</p>

<p>“What’s the problem?” asked Mr. Commissioner
again.</p>

<p>“A serious flaw, sir,” said Angel, with all
gravity. “Here’s Mimosa handicapped at seven
stone nine in the Friary Nursery, when, according
to my calculations, she can give the field a stone,
and beat any one of ’em.”</p>

<p>The Commissioner gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“My dear fellow,” he expostulated, “I thought
you were working on the Lagos Bank business.”</p>

<p>Angel had a far-away look in his eyes when he
answered—</p>

<p>“Oh, that is all finished. Old Carby was
poisoned by a man named—forget his name now,
but he was a Monrovian. I wired the Lagos
police, and we caught the chap this morning at
Liverpool—took him off an Elder, Dempster
boat.”</p>

<p>The Police Commissioner beamed.</p>

<p>“My congratulations, Angel. By Jove, I
thought we shouldn’t have a chance of helping
the people in Africa. Is there a white man
in it?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know,” said Angel absently; his
eye was wandering up and down a column of
figures on the paper before him.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to fancy there is—man named
Connor, who used to be a croupier or something
to old Reale.”</p>

<p>He frowned at the paper, and picking up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
pencil from the desk, made a rapid little
calculation. “Seven stone thirteen,” he muttered.</p>

<p>The Commissioner tapped the table impatiently.
He had sunk into a seat opposite Angel.</p>

<p>“My dear man, who is old Reale? You forget
that you are our tame foreign specialist. Lord,
Angel, if you heard half the horrid things that
people say about your appointment you would die
of shame!”</p>

<p>Angel pushed aside the papers with a little
laugh.</p>

<p>“I’m beyond shame,” he said lightheartedly;
“and, besides, I’ve heard. You were asking
about Reale. Reale is a character. For twenty
years proprietor of one of the most delightful
gambling plants in Egypt, Rome—goodness
knows where. Education—none. Hobbies—invention.
That’s the ‘bee in his bonnet’—invention.
If he’s got another, it is the common or
garden puzzle. Pigs in clover, missing words, all
the fake competitions that cheap little papers run—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
goes in for them all. Lives at 43 Terrington
Square.”</p>

<p>“Where?” The Commissioner’s eyebrows
rose. “Reale? 43 Terrington Square? Why, of
course.” He looked at Angel queerly. “You
know all about Reale?”</p>

<p>Angel shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“As much as anybody knows,” he said.</p>

<p>The Commissioner nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, take a cab and get down at once to 43
Terrington Square. Your old Reale was murdered
last night.”</p>

<p>It was peculiar of Angel Esquire that nothing
surprised him. He received the most tremendous
tidings with polite interest, and now he merely
said, “Dear me!” Later, as a swift hansom
carried him along Whitehall he permitted himself
to be “blessed.”</p>

<p>Outside No. 43 Terrington Square a small
crowd of morbid sightseers stood in gloomy anticipation
of some gruesome experience or other.
A policeman admitted him, and the local inspector<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
stopped in his interrogation of a white-faced butler
to bid him a curt “Good morning.”</p>

<p>Angel’s preliminary inspection did not take any
time. He saw the bodies, which had not yet been
removed. He examined the pockets of both men,
and ran his eye through the scattered papers on
the floor of the room in which the tragedy had
occurred. Then he came back to the big drawing-room
and saw the inspector, who was sitting
at a table writing his report.</p>

<p>“The chap on the top floor committed the murder,
of course,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“I know that,” said Inspector Boyden
brusquely.</p>

<p>“And was electrocuted by a current passing
through the handle of the safe.”</p>

<p>“I gathered that,” the inspector replied as before,
and went on with his work.</p>

<p>“The murderer’s name is Massey,” continued
Angel patiently—“George Charles Massey.”</p>

<p>The inspector turned in his seat with a sarcastic
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I <i>also</i>,” he said pointedly, “have seen the
envelopes addressed in that name, which were
found in his pocket.”</p>

<p>Angel’s face was preternaturally solemn as he
continued—</p>

<p>“The third man I am not so sure about.”</p>

<p>The inspector looked up suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Third man—which third man?”</p>

<p>Well-simulated astonishment sent Angel’s eyebrows
to the shape of inverted V’s.</p>

<p>“There was another man in it. Didn’t you
know <i>that</i>, Mr. Inspector?”</p>

<p>“I have found no evidence of the presence of
a third party,” he said stiffly; “but I have not yet
concluded my investigations.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Angel cheerfully. “When you
have, you will find the ends of three cigarettes—two
in the room where the old man was killed,
and one in the safe room. They are marked ‘Al
Kam,’ and are a fairly expensive variety of Egyptian
cigarettes. Massey smoked cigars; old Reale
did not smoke at all. The question is”—he went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
on speaking aloud to himself, and ignoring the
perplexed police official—“was it Connor or was
it Jimmy?”</p>

<p>The inspector struggled with a desire to satisfy
his curiosity at the expense of his dignity, and
resolved to maintain an attitude of superior incredulity.
He turned back to his work.</p>

<p>“It would be jolly difficult to implicate either
of them,” Angel went on reflectively, addressing
the back of the inspector. “They would produce
fifty unimpeachable alibis, and bring an action
for wrongful arrest in addition,” he added
artfully.</p>

<p>“They can’t do that,” said the inspector gruffly.</p>

<p>“Can’t they?” asked the innocent Angel.
“Well, at any rate, it’s not advisable to arrest
them. Jimmy would——”</p>

<p>Inspector Boyden swung round in his chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you’re ‘pulling my
leg,’ Mr. Angel. You are perhaps unused to the
procedure in criminal cases in London, and I must
now inform you that at present I am in charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
the case, and must request that if you have any
information bearing upon this crime to give it to
me at once.”</p>

<p>“With all the pleasure in life,” said Angel
heartily. “In the first place, Jimmy——”</p>

<p>“Full name, please.” The inspector dipped
his pen in ink.</p>

<p>“Haven’t the slightest idea,” said the other
carelessly. “Everybody knows Jimmy. He was
old Reale’s most successful decoy duck. Had the
presence and the plumage and looked alive, so
that all the other little ducks used to come flying
down and settle about him, and long before they
could discover that the beautiful bird that attracted
them was only painted wood and feathers,
‘Bang! bang!’ went old Reale’s double-barrel,
and roast duck was on the menu for days on
end.”</p>

<p>Inspector Boyden threw down his pen with a
grunt.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” he said in despair, “that I cannot
include your parable in my report. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
you have any definite information to give, I shall
be pleased to receive it.”</p>

<p>Later, at Scotland Yard, Angel interviewed the
Commissioner.</p>

<p>“What sort of a man is Boyden to work
with?” asked Mr. Commissioner.</p>

<p>“A most excellent chap—good-natured, obliging,
and as zealous as the best of ’em,” said Angel,
which was his way.</p>

<p>“I shall leave him in charge of the case,” said
the Chief.</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do better,” said Angel decisively.</p>

<p>Then he went home to his flat in Jermyn Street
to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>It was an immaculate Angel Esquire who
pushed through the plate-glass, turn-table door of
the Heinz, and, walking into the magnificent old
rose dining-room, selected a table near a window
looking out on to Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The other occupant of the table looked up and
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“Hullo, Angel!” he said easily.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Jimmy!” greeted the unconventional
detective.</p>

<p>He took up the card and chose his dishes with
elaborate care. A half-bottle of Beaujolais completed
his order.</p>

<p>“The ridiculous thing is that one has got to
pay 7s. 6d. for a small bottle of wine that any
respectable grocer will sell you for tenpence ha’-penny
net.”</p>

<p>“You must pay for the magnificence,” said the
other, quietly amused. Then, after the briefest
pause, “What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Not you, Jimmy,” said the amiable Angel,
“though my young friend, Boyden, Inspector of
Police, and a Past Chief Templar to boot, will be
looking for you shortly.”</p>

<p>Jimmy carefully chose a toothpick and stripped
it of its tissue covering.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said quietly, “I wasn’t in it—the
killing, I mean. I was there.”</p>

<p>“I know all about that,” said Angel; “saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
your foolish cigarettes. I didn’t think you had
any hand in the killing. You are a property
criminal, not a personal criminal.”</p>

<p>“By which I gather you convey the nice distinction
as between crimes against property and
crimes against the person,” said the other.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“What I want to see you about is the verse,”
said Angel, stirring his soup.</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed aloud.</p>

<p>“What a clever little devil you are, Angel,” he
said admiringly; “and not so little either, in
inches or devilishness.”</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence, and the wrinkled forehead
was eloquent.</p>

<p>“Think hard,” taunted Angel.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking,” said Jimmy slowly. “I used
a pencil, as there was no blotting paper. I only
made one copy, just as the old man dictated it,
and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“You used a block,” said Angel obligingly,
“and only tore off the top sheet. And you
pressed rather heavily on that, so that the next
sheet bore a legible impression.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked annoyed.</p>

<p>“What an ass I am!” he said, and was again
silent.</p>

<p>“The verse?” said Angel. “Can you make
head or tail of it?”</p>

<p>“No”—Jimmy shook his head—“can
you?”</p>

<p>“Not a blessed thing,” Angel frankly confessed.</p>

<p>Through the next three courses neither man
spoke. When coffee had been placed on the table,
Jimmy broke the silence—</p>

<p>“You need not worry about the verse. I have
only stolen a march of a few days. Then Connor
will have it; and some girl or other will have it.
Massey would have had it too.” He smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>“What is it all about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Jimmy looked at his questioner with some suspicion.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Haven’t got the slightest notion. That is
why I came to see you.”</p>

<p>“Curious!” mused Jimmy. “I thought of
looking <i>you</i> up for the very same purpose. We
shall know in a day or two,” he went on, beckoning
the waiter. “The old man said it was all in
the will. He just told me the verse before he
died. The ruling passion, don’t you know.
‘Learn it by heart, Jimmy,’ he croaked; ‘it’s two
millions for you if you guess it’—and that’s how
he died. My bill, waiter. Which way do you
go?” he asked as they turned into Piccadilly.</p>

<p>“To the ‘Plait’ for an hour,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“Business?”</p>

<p>“Partly; I’m looking for a man who might be
there.”</p>

<p>They crossed Piccadilly, and entered a side
turning. The second on the left and the first on
the right brought them opposite a brightly-lit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
hotel. From within came the sound of violins.
At the little tables with which the spacious bar-room
was set about sat laughing women and
young men in evening dress. A haze of cigarette
smoke clouded the atmosphere, and the music
made itself heard above a babel of laughter and
talk. They found a corner, and seated themselves.</p>

<p>“You seem to be fairly well known here,” said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Angel ruefully, “a jolly sight
too well known. You’re not quite a stranger,
Jimmy,” he added.</p>

<p>“No,” said the other a little bitterly; “but
we’re on different sides of the House, Angel.
You’re in the Cabinet, and I’m in the everlasting
Opposition.”</p>

<p>“Muffled sobs!” said Angel flippantly. “Pity
poor Ishmael who ‘ishes’ for his own pleasure!
Pathos for a fallen brother! A silent tear for
this magnificent wreck who’d rather be on the
rocks than floating any day of the week. Don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
humbug yourself, Jimmy, or I shall be falling on
your neck and appealing to your better nature.
You’re a thief just as another man is a stamp collector
or a hunter. It’s your blooming <i>forte</i>.
Hi, Charles, do you ever intend serving me?”</p>

<p>“Yessir; d’reckly, sir.”</p>

<p>Charles bustled up.</p>

<p>“What is it to be, gentlemen? Good evening,
Mr. Angel!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take what my friend Dooley calls a keg of
obscenth; and you?”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s face struggled to preserve its gravity.</p>

<p>“Lemonade,” he said soberly.</p>

<p>The waiter brought him a whisky.</p>

<p>If you do not know the “Plait” you do not
know your London. It is one of the queer hostels
which in a Continental city would be noted as
a place to which the “young person” might not
be taken. Being in London, neither Baedeker
nor any of the infallible guides to the metropolis
so much as mention its name. For there is a law
of libel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“There’s ‘Snatch’ Walker,” said Angel idly.
“Snatch isn’t wanted just now—in this country.
There’s ‘Frisco Kate,’ who’ll get a lifer one
of these days. D’ye know the boy in the mustard
suit, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>Jimmy took a sidelong glance at the young
man.</p>

<p>“No; he’s new.”</p>

<p>“Not so new either,” said Angel. “Budapest
in the racing season, Jerusalem in the tourist
season; a wealthy Hungarian nobleman
traveling for his health all the time—that’s
him.”</p>

<p>“Ambiguous, ungrammatical, but convincing,”
murmured Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I want him, by the way!” Angel had suddenly
become alert.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to have a row, I’m off,” said
Jimmy, finishing his drink.</p>

<p>Angel caught his arm. A man had entered the
saloon, and was looking round as though in search
of somebody. He caught Jimmy’s eye and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
started. Then he threaded his way through the
crowded room.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Jim——” He stopped dead as he saw
Jimmy’s companion, and his hand went into his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Connor!”—Angel’s smile was particularly
disarming—“you’re the man I want to
see.”</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” the other snarled. He
was a big, heavily-built man, with a drooping
mustache.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing,” smiled Angel. “I want
you for the Lagos job, but there’s not enough
evidence to convict you. Make your mind easy.”</p>

<p>The man went white under his tan; his hand
caught the edge of the table before him.</p>

<p>“Lagos!” he stammered. “What—what——”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind about that.” Angel airily
waved the matter aside. “Sit down here.”</p>

<p>The man hesitated, then obeyed, and dropped
into a seat between the two.</p>

<p>Angel looked round. So far as any danger of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
being overheard went, they were as much alone
as though they sat in the center of a desert.</p>

<p>“Jimmy”—Angel held him by the arm—“you
said just now you’d got a march when you admitted
you’d seen old Reale’s puzzle-verse. It
wasn’t the march you thought it was, for I had
seen the will—and so has Connor here.”</p>

<p>He looked the heavy man straight in the eye.</p>

<p>“There is somebody else that benefits under
that will besides you two. It is a girl.” He did
not take his eyes from Connor. “I was curious
to see that young lady,” Angel went on, “and
this afternoon I drove to Clapham to interview
her.”</p>

<p>He stopped again. Connor made no reply, but
kept his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>

<p>“I went to interview her, and found that she
had mysteriously disappeared this very afternoon.”</p>

<p>Again he stopped.</p>

<p>“A gentleman called to see her, with a message
from—who do you think, Connor?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>The easy, flippant manner was gone, and Connor,
looking up, caught the steady stare of two
cold blue eyes, and shivered.</p>

<p>“Why,” Angel went on slowly, “it was a message
from Inspector Angel—which is a damned
piece of impudence, Connor, for I’m not an inspector—and
the young lady drove away to Scotland
Yard. And now, Connor, I want to ask
you, <i>What have you done with old Reale’s
heiress?</i>”</p>

<p>Connor licked his lips and said nothing.</p>

<p>Angel beckoned to a waiter and paid his score,
then rose to go.</p>

<p>“You will go at once and drive Miss Kathleen
Kent back to the place you took her
from. I shall call to-morrow and see her,
and if one hair of her head is harmed,
Connor——”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Connor defiantly.</p>

<p>“I’ll chance your alibis, and take you for the
Lagos business,” and with a curt nod to Jimmy,
he left the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Connor turned in a fret of fury to the man at
his side.</p>

<p>“D’ye hear him, Jimmy? D’ye hear the
dog——”</p>

<p>“My advice to you,” interrupted the other, “is—do
as Angel tells you.”</p>

<p>“D’ye think I’m frightened by——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” was the quiet response, “you are
not frightened at what Angel may do. What he
does won’t matter very much. What I will do is
the trouble.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>THE “BOROUGH LOT”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not a bit like Scotland Yard as Kathleen
Kent had pictured it. It was a kind of a yard
certainly, for the grimy little street, flanked on
either side with the blank faces of dirty little
houses, ended abruptly in a high wall, over which
were the gray hulls and fat scarlet funnels of
ocean-going steamers.</p>

<p>The driver of the cab had pulled up before one
of the houses near the wall, and a door had
opened. Then the man who had sat with her in
glum silence, answering her questions in mono-syllables,
grasped her arm and hurried her into
the house. The door slammed behind, and she
realized her deadly peril. She had had a foreboding,
an instinctive premonition that all was not
well when the cab had turned from the broad
thoroughfare that led to where she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
imagined Scotland Yard would be, and had, taking
short cuts through innumerable mean streets,
moved at a sharp pace eastward. Ignorant of
that London which begins at Trafalgar Square
and runs eastward to Walthamstow, ignorant, indeed,
of that practical suburb to which the modesty
of an income produced by £4,000 worth of
Consols had relegated her, she felt without knowing,
that Scotland Yard did not lay at the eastern
end of Commercial Road.</p>

<p>Then when the door of the little house slammed
and a hand grasped her arm tightly, and a thick
voice whispered in her ear that if she screamed
the owner of the voice would “out” her, she
gathered, without exactly knowing what an “outing”
was, that it would be wiser for her not to
scream, so she quietly accompanied her captor up
the stairs. He stopped for a moment on the
rickety landing, then pushed open a door.</p>

<p>Before the window that would in the ordinary
course of events admit the light of day hung a
heavy green curtain; behind this, though she did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
not know it, three army blankets, judiciously
fixed, effectively excluded the sunlight, and as
effectually veiled the rays of a swing-lamp from
outside observation.</p>

<p>The girl made a pathetically incongruous figure,
as she stood white but resolute before the
occupants of the room.</p>

<p>Kathleen Kent was something more than
pretty, something less than beautiful. An oval
face with gray, steadfast eyes, a straight nose and
the narrow upper lip of the aristocrat, her lips
were, perhaps, too full and too human for your
connoisseur of beauty.</p>

<p>She looked from face to face, and but for her
pallor she exhibited no sign of fear.</p>

<p>Although she was unaware of the fact, she had
been afforded an extraordinary privilege. By the
merest accident, she had been ushered into the
presence of the “Borough Lot.” Not a very
heroic title for an organized band of criminals,
but, then, organized criminals never take unto
themselves generic and high-falutin’ titles. Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
“Silver Hatchets” and “Red Knives” are boy
hooligans who shoot off toy pistols. The police
referred to them vaguely as the “Borough Lot.”
Lesser lights in the criminal world have been
known to boast that they were not unconnected
with that combination; and when some desperate
piece of villainy startled the world, the police investigating
the crime started from this point:
Was it committed by one of the Borough Lot, or
was it not?</p>

<p>As Kathleen was pushed into the room by her
captor, a hum of subdued conversation ended
abruptly, and she was the focus of nine pairs of
passionless eyes that looked at her unsmilingly.</p>

<p>When she had heard the voices, when she took
her first swift glance at the room, and had seen
the type of face that met hers, she had steeled
herself for an outburst of coarse amusement. She
feared—she did not know what she feared.
Strangely enough, the dead silence that greeted
her gave her courage, the cold stare of the men
nerved her. Only one of the men lost his composure.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
The tall, heavy-looking man who sat
at one end of the room with bowed, attentive head
listening to a little clean-shaven man with side-whiskers,
who looked for all the world like an
old-fashioned jockey, started with a muttered
oath.</p>

<p>“Upstairs!” he roared, and said something
rapidly in a foreign tongue that sent the man who
held the girl’s arm staggering back with a
blanched face.</p>

<p>“I—I,” he stammered appealingly, “I didn’t
understand.”</p>

<p>The tall man, his face flushed with rage,
pointed to the door, and hastily opening the door,
her captor half dragged the bewildered girl to the
darkness of the landing.</p>

<p>“This way,” he muttered, and she could feel
his hand trembling as he stumbled up yet another
flight of stairs, never once relinquishing his hold
of her. “Don’t you scream nor nothing, or you’ll
get into trouble. You see what happened to me
for takin’ you into the wrong room. Oh, he’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
devil is Connor—Smith, I mean. Smith’s his
name, d’ye hear?” He shook her arm roughly.
Evidently the man was beside himself with terror.
What dreadful thing the tall man had said, Kathleen
could only judge. She herself was half dead
with fright. The sinister faces of these men, the
mystery of this assembly in the shuttered room,
her abduction, all combined to add terror to her
position.</p>

<p>Her conductor unlocked a door and pushed her
in. This had evidently been prepared for her reception,
for a table had been laid, and food and
drink stood ready.</p>

<p>The door was closed behind her, and a bolt was
slipped. Like the chamber below, all daylight
was kept out by a curtain. Her first thoughts
were of escape. She waited till the footsteps on
the rickety stairs had died away, then crossed the
room swiftly. The drop from the window could
not be very far; she would risk it. She drew
aside the curtain. Where the window should
have been was a sheet of steel plate. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
screwed to the joists. Somebody had anticipated
her resolve to escape by the window. In chalk,
written in an illiterate hand, was the sentence:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“You wont be hert if your senserble.</div>
<div class="verse">We want to know some questions</div>
<div class="verse">then well let you go. Dont make</div>
<div class="verse">a fuss or it will be bad for you.</div>
<div class="verse">Keep quite and tell us these questions</div>
<div class="verse">and well let you go.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>What had they to ask, or she to answer? She
knew of nothing that she could inform them upon.
Who were these men who were detaining her?
During the next hours she asked herself these
questions over and over again. She grew faint
with hunger and thirst, but the viands spread
upon the table she did not touch. The mystery
of her capture bewildered her. Of what value
was she to these men? All the time the murmur
of voices in the room below was continuous.
Once or twice she heard a voice raised in anger.
Once a door slammed, and somebody went clattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
down the stairs. There was a door-keeper,
she could hear him speak with the
outgoer.</p>

<p>Did she but know it, the question that perplexed
her was an equal matter of perplexity with others
in the house that evening.</p>

<p>The notorious men upon whom she had looked,
all innocent of their claim to notoriety, were themselves
puzzled.</p>

<p>Bat Sands, the man who looked so ill—he had
the unhealthy appearance of one who had just
come through a long sickness—was an inquirer.
Vennis—nobody knew his Christian name—was
another, and they were two men whose inquiries
were not to be put off.</p>

<p>Vennis turned his dull fish eyes upon big Connor,
and spoke with deliberation.</p>

<p>“Connor, what’s this girl business? Are we
in it?”</p>

<p>Connor knew his men too well to temporize.</p>

<p>“You’re in it, if it’s worth anything,” he said
slowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>Bat’s close-cropped red head was thrust forward.</p>

<p>“Is there money in it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Connor nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Much?”</p>

<p>Connor drew a deep breath. If the truth be
told, that the “Lot” should share, was the last
thing he had intended. But for the blundering
of his agent, they would have remained in ignorance
of the girl’s presence in the house. But the
very suspicion of disloyalty was dangerous. He
knew his men, and they knew him. There was
not a man there who would hesitate to destroy
him at the merest hint of treachery. Candor was
the best and safest course.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty hard to give you any idea what I’ve
got the girl here for, but there’s a million in it,”
he began.</p>

<p>He knew they believed him. He did not expect
to be disbelieved. Criminals of the class
these men represented flew high. They were out
of the ruck of petty, boasting sneak-thieves who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
lied to one another, knowing they lied, and knowing
that their hearers knew they lied.</p>

<p>Only the strained, intent look on their faces
gave any indication of how the news had been
received.</p>

<p>“It’s old Reale’s money,” he continued; “he’s
left the lot to four of us. Massey’s dead, so that
makes three.”</p>

<p>There was no need to explain who was Reale,
who Massey. A week ago Massey had himself
sat in that room and discussed with Connor the
cryptic verse that played so strange a part in the
old man’s will. He had been, in a way, an honorary
member of the “Borough Lot.”</p>

<p>Connor continued. He spoke slowly, waiting
for inspiration. A judicious lie might save the
situation. But no inspiration came, and he found
his reluctant tongue speaking the truth.</p>

<p>“The money is stored in one safe. Oh, it’s no
use looking like that, Tony, you might just as
well try to crack the Bank of England as that
crib. Yes, he converted every cent of a million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
and three-quarters into hard, solid cash—banknotes
and gold. This he put into his damned
safe, and locked. And he has left by the terms
of his will a key.”</p>

<p>Connor was a man who did not find speaking
an easy matter. Every word came slowly and
hesitatingly, as though the speaker of the story
were loth to part with it.</p>

<p>“The key is here,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>There was a rustle of eager anticipation as he
dipped his hand in his waistcoat pocket. When
he withdrew his fingers, they contained only a slip
of paper carefully folded.</p>

<p>“The lock of the safe is one of Reale’s inventions;
it opens to no key save this.” He
shook the paper before them, then lapsed into
silence.</p>

<p>“Well,” broke in Bat impatiently, “why don’t
you open the safe? And what has the girl to do
with it?”</p>

<p>“She also has a key, or will have to-morrow.
And Jimmy——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>A laugh interrupted him. “Curt” Goyle had
been an attentive listener till Jimmy’s name was
mentioned, then his harsh, mirthless laugh broke
the tense silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord James is in it, is he? I’m one that’s
for ruling Jimmy out.” He got up on his feet
and stretched himself, keeping his eye fixed on
Connor. “If you want to know why, I’ll tell ye.
Jimmy’s a bit too finicking for my taste, too fond
of the police for my taste. If we’re in this,
Jimmy’s out of it,” and a mutter of approval
broke from the men.</p>

<p>Connor’s mind was working quickly. He could
do without Jimmy, he could not dispense with the
help of the “Lot.” He was just a little afraid
of Jimmy. The man was a type of criminal he
could not understand. If he was a rival claimant
for Reale’s millions, the gang would “out”
Jimmy; so much the better. Massey’s removal
had limited the legatees to three. Jimmy out of
the way would narrow the chance of his losing
the money still further; and the other legatee was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in the room upstairs. Goyle’s declaration had
set loose the tongues of the men, and he could
hear no voice that spoke for Jimmy. And then
a dozen voices demanded the rest of the story,
and amid a dead silence Connor told the story of
the will and the puzzle-verse, the solving of which
meant fortune to every man.</p>

<p>“And the girl has got to stand in and take her
share. She’s too dangerous to be let loose.
There’s nigh on two millions at stake and I’m
taking no risks. She shall remain here till the
word is found. We’re not going to see her carry
off the money under our very noses.”</p>

<p>“And Jimmy?” Goyle asked.</p>

<p>Connor fingered a lapel of his coat nervously.
He knew what answer the gang had already
framed to the question Goyle put. He knew he
would be asked to acquiesce in the blackest piece
of treachery that had ever disfigured his evil life;
but he knew, too, that Jimmy was hated by the
men who formed this strange fraternity. Jimmy
worked alone; he shared neither risk nor reward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
His cold cynicism was above their heads. They
too feared him.</p>

<p>Connor cleared his throat</p>

<p>“Perhaps if we reasoned——”</p>

<p>Goyle and Bat exchanged swift glances.</p>

<p>“Ask him to come and talk it over to-night,”
said Goyle carelessly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Connor is a long time gone.”</p>

<p>Sands turned his unhealthy face to the company
as he spoke.</p>

<p>Three hours had passed since Connor had left
the gang in his search for Jimmy.</p>

<p>“He’ll be back soon,” said Goyle confidently.
He looked over the assembly of men. “Any of
you fellers who don’t want to be in this business
can go.” Then he added significantly, “We’re
going to settle with Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Nobody moved; no man shuddered at the
dreadful suggestion his words conveyed.</p>

<p>“A million an’ three-quarters—it’s worth
hanging for!” he said callously. He walked to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
a tall, narrow cupboard that ran up by the side of
the fireplace and pulled open the door. There
was room for a man to stand inside. The scrutiny
of the interior gave him some satisfaction.</p>

<p>“This is where some one stood”—he looked
meaningly at Bat Sands—“when he koshed Ike
Steen—Ike with the police money in his
pocket, and ready to sell every man jack of
you.”</p>

<p>“Who’s in the next house?” a voice asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>Goyle laughed. He was the virtual landlord so
far as the hiring of the house was concerned. He
closed the cupboard door.</p>

<p>“Not counting old George, it’s empty,” he
said. “Listen!”</p>

<p>In the deep silence there came the faint murmur
of a voice through the thin walls.</p>

<p>“Talkin’ to himself,” said Goyle with a grin;
“he’s daft, and he’s as good as a watchman for
us, for he scares away the children and women
who would come prying about here. He’s——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>They heard the front door shut quickly and
the voices of two men in the passage below.</p>

<p>Goyle sprang to his feet, an evil look on his
face.</p>

<p>“That’s Jimmy!” he whispered hurriedly.</p>

<p>As the feet sounded on the stairs he walked to
where his coat hung and took something from his
pocket, then, almost as the newcomers entered the
room, he slipped into the cupboard and drew the
door close after him.</p>

<p>Jimmy, entering the room in Connor’s wake,
felt the chill of his reception. He felt, too, some
indefinable sensation of danger. There was an
ominous quiet. Bat Sands was polite, even servile.
Jimmy noticed that, and his every sense
became alert. Bat thrust forward a chair
and placed it with its back toward the cupboard.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Jimmy,” he said with forced heartiness.
“We want a bit of a talk.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sat down.</p>

<p>“I also want a bit of a talk,” he said calmly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
“There is a young lady in this house, brought
here against her will. You’ve got to let her
go.”</p>

<p>The angry mutter of protest that he had expected
did not come, rather was his dictum received
in complete silence. This was bad, and
he looked round for the danger. Then he missed
a face.</p>

<p>“Where is our friend Goyle, our dear landlord?”
he asked with pleasant irony.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been here to-day,” Bat hastened to
say.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at Connor standing by the door
biting his nails, and Connor avoided his eye.</p>

<p>“Ah!” Jimmy’s unconcern was perfectly
simulated.</p>

<p>“Jimmy wants us to send the girl back.” Connor
was speaking hurriedly. “He thinks there’ll
be trouble, and his friend the ’tec thinks there
will be trouble too.”</p>

<p>Jimmy heard the artfully-worded indictment
unmoved. Again he noticed, with some concern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
that what was tantamount to a charge of treachery
was received without a word.</p>

<p>“It isn’t what others think, it is what I think,
Connor,” he said dryly. “The girl has got to go
back. I want Reale’s money as much as you, but
I have a fancy to play fair this journey.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you have, <i>have</i> you,” sneered Connor.
He had seen the cupboard door behind Jimmy
move ever so slightly.</p>

<p>Jimmy sat with his legs crossed on the chair
that had been placed for him. The light overcoat
he had worn over his evening dress lay across
his knees. Connor knew the moment was at
hand, and concentrated his efforts to keep his
former comrade’s attentions engaged. He had
guessed the meaning of Goyle’s absence from the
room and the moving cupboard door. In his
present position Jimmy was helpless.</p>

<p>Connor had been nervous to a point of incoherence
on the way to the house. Now his voice
rose to a strident pitch.</p>

<p>“You’re too clever, Jimmy,” he said, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
there are too many ‘musts’ about you to please
us. We say that the girl has got to stay, and by
—— we mean it!”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s wits were at work. The danger was
very close at hand, he felt that. He must change
his tactics. He had depended too implicitly upon
Connor’s fear of him, and had reckoned without
the “Borough Lot.” From which of these men
did danger threaten? He took their faces in in
one comprehensive glance. He knew them—he
had their black histories at his finger-tips. Then
he saw a coat hanging on the wall at the farther
end of the room. He recognized the garment instantly.
It was Goyle’s. Where was the owner?
He temporized.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest desire to upset anybody’s
plans,” he drawled, and started drawing
on a white glove, as though about to depart. “I
am willing to hear your views, but I would point
out that I have an equal interest in the young
lady, Connor.”</p>

<p>He gazed reflectively into the palm of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
gloved hand as if admiring the fit. There was
something so peculiar in this apparently innocent
action, that Connor started forward with an
oath.</p>

<p>“Quick, Goyle!” he shouted; but Jimmy was
out of his chair and was standing with his back
against the cupboard, and in Jimmy’s ungloved
hand was an ugly black weapon that was all butt
and barrel.</p>

<p>He waved them back, and they shrank away
from him.</p>

<p>“Let me see you all,” he commanded, “none
of your getting behind one another. I want to
see what you are doing. Get away from that
coat of yours, Bat, or I’ll put a bullet in your
stomach.”</p>

<p>He had braced himself against the door in anticipation
of the thrust of the man, but it seemed
as though the prisoner inside had accepted the
situation, for he made no sign.</p>

<p>“So you are all wondering how I knew about
the cupboard,” he jeered. He held up the gloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
hand, and in the palm something flashed back the
light of the lamp.</p>

<p>Connor knew. The tiny mirror sewn in the
palm of the sharper’s glove was recognized equipment.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen,” said Jimmy with a mocking
laugh, “I must insist on having my way.
Connor, you will please bring to me the lady you
abducted this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Connor hesitated; then he intercepted a glance
from Bat Sands, and sullenly withdrew from the
room.</p>

<p>Jimmy did not speak till Connor had returned
ushering in the white-faced girl. He saw that
she looked faint and ill, and motioned one of the
men to place a chair for her. What she saw
amidst that forbidding group was a young man
with a little Vandyke beard, who looked at her
with grave, thoughtful eyes. He was a gentleman,
she could see that, and her heart leapt
within her as she realized that the presence of
this man in the fashionably-cut clothes and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
most unfashionable pistol meant deliverance from
this horrible place.</p>

<p>“Miss Kent,” he said kindly.</p>

<p>She nodded, she could not trust herself to
speak. The experience of the past few hours
had almost reduced her to a state of collapse.</p>

<p>Jimmy saw the girl was on the verge of a
breakdown.</p>

<p>“I am going to take you home,” he said, and
added whimsically, “and cannot but feel that you
have underrated your opportunities. Not often
will you see gathered together so splendid a collection
of our profession.” He waved his hand
in introduction. “Bat Sands, Miss Kent, a most
lowly thief, possibly worse. George Collroy,
coiner and a ferocious villain. Vennis, who follows
the lowest of all grades of dishonest livelihood—blackmailer.
Here,” Jimmy went on, as
he stepped aside from the cupboard, “is the gem
of the collection. I will show you our friend who
has so coyly effaced himself.” He addressed the
occupant of the cupboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Come out, Goyle,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>There was no response.</p>

<p>Jimmy pointed to one of the ruffians in the
room.</p>

<p>“Open that door,” he commanded.</p>

<p>The man slunk forward and pulled the door
open.</p>

<p>“Come out, Goyle,” he growled, then stepped
back with blank astonishment stamped upon his
face. “Why—why,” he gasped, “there’s nobody
there!”</p>

<p>With a cry, Jimmy started forward. One
glance convinced him that the man spoke the
truth, and then——</p>

<p>There were keen wits in that crowd—men used
to crises and quick to act. Bat Sands saw
Jimmy’s attention diverted for a moment, and
Jimmy’s pistol hand momentarily lowered. To
think with Bat Sands was to act. Jimmy,
turning back upon the “Lot,” saw the life-preserver
descending, and leapt on one side;
then, as he recovered, somebody threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
a coat at the lamp, and the room was in
darkness.</p>

<p>Jimmy reached out his hand and caught the girl
by the arm. “Into that cupboard,” he whispered,
pushing her into the recess from which
Goyle had so mysteriously vanished. Then, with
one hand on the edge of the door, he groped
around with his pistol for his assailants. He
could hear their breathing and the creak of the
floorboards as they came toward him. He
crouched down by the door, judging that the
“kosh” would be aimed in a line with his head.
By and by he heard the swish of the descending
stick, and “crash!” the preserver struck the wall
above him.</p>

<p>He was confronted with a difficulty; to fire
would be to invite trouble. He had no desire to
attract the attention of the police for many reasons.
Unless the life of the girl was in danger he
resolved to hold his fire, and when Ike Josephs,
feeling cautiously forward with his stick, blundered
into Jimmy, Ike suddenly dropped to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
floor without a cry, because he had been hit a
fairly vicious blow in that portion of the
anatomy which is dignified with the title “solar
plexus.”</p>

<p>It was just after this that he heard a startled
little cry from the girl behind him, and then a
voice that sent his heart into his mouth.</p>

<p>“All right! All right! All right!”</p>

<p>There was only one man who used that tag, and
Jimmy’s heart rose up to bless his name in thankfulness.</p>

<p>“This way, Miss Kent,” said the voice, “mind
the little step. Don’t be afraid of the gentleman
on the floor, he’s handcuffed and strapped and
gagged, and is perfectly harmless.”</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. The mystery of Angel’s intimate
knowledge of the “Lot’s” plans and of
Connor’s movements, the disappearance of Goyle,
were all explained. He did not know for certain
that the occupant of the “empty” house next
door had industriously cut through the thin party-walls
that separated the two houses, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
rigged up a “back” to the cupboard that was
really a door, but he guessed it.</p>

<p>Then a blinding ray of light shot into the room
where the “Borough Lot” still groped for its
enemy, and a gentle voice said—</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, you may make your choice which
way you go—out by the front door, where my
friend, Inspector Collyer, with quite a large number
of men, is waiting; or by the back door, where
Sergeant Murtle and exactly seven plain-clothes
men are impatiently expecting you.”</p>

<p>Bat recognized the voice.</p>

<p>“Angel Esquire!” he cried in consternation.</p>

<p>From the darkness behind the dazzling electric
lamp that threw a narrow lane of light into the
apartment came an amused chuckle.</p>

<p>“What is it,” asked Angel’s persuasive voice,
“a cop?”</p>

<p>“It’s a fair cop,” said Bat truthfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>THE CRYPTOGRAM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Spedding</span> looked at his watch. He stood
upon the marble-tiled floor of the Great Deposit.
High above his head, suspended from the beautiful
dome, blazed a hundred lights from an ornate
electrolier. He paced before the great pedestal
that towered up from the center of the building,
and the floor was criss-crossed with the shadows
of the steel framework that encased it. But for
the dozen chairs that were placed in a semicircle
before the great granite base, the big hall was
bare and unfurnished.</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding walked up and down, and his
footsteps rang hollow; when he spoke the misty
space of the building caught up his voice and sent
down droning echoes.</p>

<p>“There is only the lady to come,” he said,
looking at his watch again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>He spoke to the two men who sat at either extreme
of the crescent of chairs. The one was
Jimmy, a brooding, thoughtful figure; the other
was Connor, ill at ease and subdued. Behind the
chairs, at some distance, stood two men who
looked like artisans, as indeed they were: at their
feet lay a bag of tools, and on a small board a
heap that looked like sand. At the door a stolid-looking
commissionaire waited, his breast glittering
with medals.</p>

<p>Footsteps sounded in the vestibule, the rustle
of a woman’s dress, and Kathleen Kent entered,
closely followed by Angel Esquire. At him the
lawyer looked questioningly as he walked forward
to greet the girl.</p>

<p>“Mr. Angel has kindly offered me his help,”
she said timidly—then, recognizing Connor,
her face flushed—“and if necessary, his protection.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding bowed.</p>

<p>“I hope you will not find this part of the ceremony
trying,” he said in a low voice, and led the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
girl to a chair. Then he made a signal to the
commissionaire.</p>

<p>“What is going to happen?” Kathleen whispered
to her companion, and Angel shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I can only guess,” he replied in the same tone.</p>

<p>He was looking up at the great safe wherein
he knew was stored the wealth of the dead gambler,
and wondering at the freakish ingenuity that
planned and foresaw this strange scene. The
creak of footsteps in the doorway made him turn
his head. He saw a white-robed figure, and behind
him a black-coated man in attendance, holding
on a cushion a golden casket. Then the
dread, familiar words brought him to his feet
with a shiver:—</p>

<p>“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the
Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.”</p>

<p>The clergyman’s solemn voice resounded
through the building, and the detective realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that the ashes of the dead man were coming to
their last abiding-place. The slow procession
moved toward the silent party. Slowly it paced
toward the column; then, as the clergyman’s feet
rang on the steel stairway that wound upward, he
began the Psalm which of all others perhaps most
fitted the passing of old Reale:—</p>

<p>“Have mercy upon me, O God, after Thy great
goodness.... Wash me thoroughly from my
wickedness: and cleanse me from my sin....
Behold, I was shapen in wickedness.... Deliver
me from bloodguiltiness, O God....”</p>

<p>Half-way up the column a small gap yawned in
the unbroken granite face, and into this the golden
cabinet was pushed; then the workman, who had
formed one of the little party that wound upward,
lifted a smooth cube of polished granite.</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God
of His great mercy to take unto Himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed....”</p>

<p>The mason’s trowel grated on the edges of the
cavity, the block of stone was thrust in until it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
was flush with the surface of the pedestal. Carved
on the end of the stone were four words:—</p>

<p class="center">Pulvis<br>
Cinis<br>
et<br>
Nihil.</p>

<p>It was when the workmen had been dismissed,
and the lawyer was at the door bidding adieu to
the priest whose strange duty had been performed,
that Angel crossed to where Jimmy sat.</p>

<p>He caught Jimmy’s grim smile, and raised his
eyes to where all that was mortal of Reale had
been placed.</p>

<p>“The Latin?” asked Angel.</p>

<p>“Surprising, isn’t it?” said the other quietly.
“Reale had seen things, you know. A man who
travels picks up information.” He nodded toward
the epitaph. “He got that idea at Toledo,
in the cathedral there. Do you know it? A slab
of brass over a dead king-maker, Portocarrero,
‘Hic jacet pulvis cinis et nihil.’ I translated it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
for him; the conceit pleased him. Sitting here,
watching his strange funeral, I wondered if ‘pulvis
cinis et nihil’ would come into it.”</p>

<p>And now Spedding came creaking back. The
workmen had disappeared, the outer door was
closed, and the commissionaire had retired to his
room leading from the vestibule. In Spedding’s
hand was a bundle of papers. He took his place
with his back to the granite pedestal and lost no
time in preliminaries.</p>

<p>“I have here the will of the late James Ryan
Reale,” he began. “The contents of this will
are known to every person here except Miss
Kent.” He had a dry humor of his own, this
lawyer, as his next words proved. “A week ago
a very clever burglary was committed in my
office: the safe was opened, a private dispatch
box forced, and my papers ransacked. I must
do my visitor justice”—he bowed slightly, first
in the direction of Connor, then toward Jimmy—“and
say that nothing was taken and practically
nothing disturbed. There was plenty of evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
that the object of the burglary was to secure a
sight of this will.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was unperturbed at the scarcely-veiled
charge, and if he moved it was only with the object
of taking up an easier position in the chair.
Not even the shocked eyes of the girl that looked
appealingly toward him caused him any apparent
uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he said, as the lawyer paused as
though waiting for an admission. He was
quietly amused. He knew very well now who
this considerate burglar was.</p>

<p>“By copying this will the burglar or burglars
obtained an unfair advantage over the other
legatee or legatees.”</p>

<p>The stiff paper crackled noisily as he unfolded
the document in his hand.</p>

<p>“I will formally read the will and afterwards
explain it to such of you as need the explanation,”
Spedding resumed.</p>

<p>The girl listened as the lawyer began to read.
Confused by the legal terminology, the endless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
repetitions, and the chaotic verbiage of the instrument,
she yet realized as the reading went on that
this last will and testament of old Reale was
something extraordinary. There was mention of
houses and estates, freeholds and bonds ...
“... and all the residue of any property whatsoever
and wheresoever absolutely” that went to
somebody. To whom she could not gather. Once
she thought it was to herself, “to Francis Corydon
Kent, Esquire, or the heirs of his body;”
once it sounded as though this huge fortune was
to be inherited by “James Cavendish Fairfax
Stannard, Baronet of the United Kingdom.” She
wondered if this was Jimmy, and remembered in
a vague way that she had heard that the ninth
baronet of that name was a person of questionable
character. Then again it seemed as if the
legatee was to be “Patrick George Connor.”
There was a doggerel verse in the will that the
lawyer gabbled through, and something about the
great safe, then the lawyer came to an end. In
the conventional declaration of the witnesses lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
a sting that sent a dull red flush to Connor’s cheek
and again provoked Jimmy’s grim smile.</p>

<p>The lawyer read:—</p>

<p>“Signed by the above James Ryan Reale as his
last will and testament (the word ‘thief’ after
‘James Cavendish Fairfax Stannard, Baronet of
the United Kingdom,’ and the word ‘thief’ after
‘Patrick George Connor,’ in the twentieth and
twenty-third lines from the top hereof, having
been deleted), in the presence of us....”</p>

<p>The lawyer folded the will perversely and put
it in his pocket. Then he took four slips of paper
from an envelope.</p>

<p>“It is quite clear to you gentlemen.” He did
not wait for the men’s reply, but went on addressing
the bewildered girl.</p>

<p>“To you, Miss Kent, I am afraid the will is
not so clear. I will explain it in a few words.
My late client was the owner of a gambling establishment.
Thus he amassed a huge fortune,
which he has left to form, if I may so put it, a
large prize fund. The competitors are yourselves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Frankly, it is a competition between the
dupes, or the heirs of the dupes, who were ruined
by my late client, and the men who helped in the
fleecing.”</p>

<p>The lawyer spoke dispassionately, as though
expounding some hypothesis, but there was that
in his tone which made Connor wince.</p>

<p>“Your father, my dear young lady, was one of
these dupes many years ago—you must have been
at school at the time. He became suddenly a
poor man.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face grew hard.</p>

<p>“So that was how it happened,” she said
slowly.</p>

<p>“That is how it happened,” the lawyer repeated
gravely. “Your father’s fortune was one
of four great fortunes that went into the coffers
of my late client.” The formal description of
Reale seemed to lend him an air of respectability.
“The other three have long since died, neither of
them leaving issue. You are the sole representative
of the victims. These gentlemen are—let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
say—in opposition. This safe,” he waved his
hand toward the great steel room that crowned
the granite column, “contains the fortune. The
safe itself is the invention of my late client.
Where the lock should be are six dials, on each of
which are the letters of the alphabet. The dials
are ranged one inside the other, and on one side
is a steel pointer. A word of six letters opens
the safe. By turning the dials so that the letters
come opposite the pointer, and form this word,
the door is opened.”</p>

<p>He stopped to wipe his forehead, for in the
energy of his explanation he had become hot.
Then he resumed—</p>

<p>“What that word is, is for you to discover.
My late client, who had a passion for acrostics
and puzzles and inventions of every kind, has left
a doggerel verse which he most earnestly assured
me contained the solution.”</p>

<p>He handed a slip first to the girl and then to
the others. For a moment the world swam before
Kathleen’s eyes. All that hinged upon that little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
verse came home to her. Carefully conning each
word, as if in fear of its significance escaping
her, she read:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Here’s a puzzle in language old,</div>
<div class="verse">Find my meaning and get my gold.</div>
<div class="verse">Take one Bolt—just one, no more—</div>
<div class="verse">Fix it on behind a Door.</div>
<div class="verse">Place it at a river’s Mouth</div>
<div class="verse">East or west or north or south.</div>
<div class="verse">Take some Leaves and put them whole</div>
<div class="verse">In some water in a Bowl.</div>
<div class="verse">I found this puzzle in a book</div>
<div class="verse">From which some mighty truths were took.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>She read again and yet again, the others watching
her. With every reading she seemed to get
further from the solution of the mystery, and she
turned in despair to Angel.</p>

<p>“I can make nothing of it,” she cried helplessly,
“nothing, nothing, nothing.”</p>

<p>“It is, with due respect to my late client, the
veriest doggerel,” said the lawyer frankly, “and
yet upon that the inheritance of the whole of his
fortune depends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>He had noticed that neither Connor nor Jimmy
had read the slips he had handed to them.</p>

<p>“The paper I have given you is a facsimile
reproduction of the original copy, and that may
be inspected at any time at my office.”</p>

<p>The girl was scanning the rhyme in an agony
of perplexity.</p>

<p>“I shall never do it,” she said in despair.</p>

<p>Angel took the paper gently from her hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t attempt it,” he said kindly. “There is
plenty of time. I do not think that either of your
rival competitors have gained anything by the
advantage they have secured. I also have had in
my possession a copy of the rhyme for the past
week.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes opened wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>“You?” she said.</p>

<p>Angel’s explanation was arrested by a singular
occurrence.</p>

<p>Connor sat at one end of the row of chairs
moodily eying the paper. Jimmy, thoughtfully
stroking his beard at the other end, suddenly rose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and walked to where his brooding confederate
sat. The man shrunk back as he approached,
and Jimmy, seating himself by his side, bent forward
and said something in a low voice. He
spoke rapidly, and Angel, watching them closely,
saw a look of incredulous surprise come into Connor’s
face. Then wrath and incredulity mingled,
and Connor sprang up, striking the back of the
chair with his fist.</p>

<p>“What?” he roared. “Give up a chance of a
fortune? I’ll see you——”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s voice never rose, but he gripped
Connor’s arm and pulled him down into his
chair.</p>

<p>“I won’t! I won’t! D’ye think I’m going to
throw away——”</p>

<p>Jimmy released the man’s arm and rose with a
shrug of his shoulders.</p>

<p>He walked to where Kathleen was standing.</p>

<p>“Miss Kent,” he said, and hesitated. “It is
difficult for me to say what I have to say; but I
want to tell you that so far as I am concerned the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
fortune is yours. I shall make no claim to it, and
I will afford you every assistance that lies in my
power to discover the word that is hidden in the
verse.”</p>

<p>The girl made no reply. Her lips were set
tight, and the hard look that Angel had noticed
when the lawyer had referred to her father came
back again.</p>

<p>Jimmy waited a moment for her to speak, but
she made no sign, and with a slight bow he
walked toward the door.</p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>It was Kathleen that spoke, and Jimmy turned
and waited.</p>

<p>“As I understand this will,” she said slowly,
“you are one of the men to whom my father
owed his ruin.”</p>

<p>His eyes met hers unfalteringly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“One of the men that I have to thank for years
of misery and sorrow,” she continued. “When I
saw my father slowly sinking, a broken-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
man, weighed down with the knowledge of the
folly that had brought his wife and child to comparative
poverty; when I saw my father die,
crushed in spirit by his misfortunes, I never
thought I should meet the man who brought his
ruin about.”</p>

<p>Still Jimmy’s gaze did not waver. Impassive,
calm and imperturbable, he listened unmoved to
the bitter indictment.</p>

<p>“This will says you were a man of my father’s
own class, one who knew the tricks by which a
gentle, simple man, with a childish faith in such
men as you, might be lured into temptation.”</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply, and the girl went on in
biting tones—</p>

<p>“A few days ago you helped me to escape from
men whom you introduced with an air of superiority
as thieves and blackmailers. That it was
you who rendered me this service I shall regret to
the end of my days. You! You! You!” She
flung out her hand scornfully. “If they were
thieves, what are you? A gambler’s tout? A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
decoy? A harpy preying on the weakness of
your unfortunate fellows?”</p>

<p>She turned to Connor.</p>

<p>“Had this man offered me his help I might
have accepted it. Had he offered to forego his
claim to this fortune I might have been impressed
by his generosity. From you, whom God gave
advantages of birth and education, and who
utilized them to bring ruin and disaster on such
men as my father, the offer is an insult!”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s face was deadly pale, but he made no
sign. Only his eyes shone brighter, and the
hand that twisted the point of his beard twitched
nervously.</p>

<p>The girl turned to Angel wearily. Her outburst
and the tension of the evening had exhausted
her.</p>

<p>“Will you take me home, Mr. Angel?” she
said.</p>

<p>She offered her hand to the lawyer, who had
been an interested observer of the scene, and
ignoring the two men, she turned to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Then Jimmy spoke.</p>

<p>“I do not attempt to excuse myself, Miss
Kent,” he said evenly; “for my life and my acts
I am unaccountable to man or woman. Your
condemnation makes it neither easier nor harder
to live my life. Your charity might have made
a difference.”</p>

<p>He held out a detaining hand, for Kathleen
had gathered up her skirts to move away.</p>

<p>“I have considered your question fairly. I
am one of the men to whom your father owed his
ruin, insomuch as I was one of Reale’s associates.
I am <i>not</i> one of the men, insomuch as I used
my every endeavor to dissuade your father from
taking the risks he took.”</p>

<p>The humor of some recollection took hold of
him, and a grim little smile came into his face.</p>

<p>“You say I betrayed your father,” he said in
the same quiet tone. “As a fact I betrayed
Reale. I was at trouble to explain to your father
the secret of Reale’s electric roulette table; I
demonstrated the futility of risking another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
farthing.” He laughed. “I have said I would
not excuse myself, and here I am pleading like a
small boy, ‘If you please, it wasn’t me,’” he
said a little impatiently; and then he added
abruptly, “I will not detain you,” and walked
away.</p>

<p>He knew instinctively that she waited a moment
hesitating for a reply, then he heard the
rustle of her dress and knew she had gone. He
stood looking upward to where the graven granite
set marked the ashes of Reale, until her footsteps
had died away and the lawyer’s voice broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“Now, Sir James——” he began, and Jimmy
spun round with an oath, his face white with
passion.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” he said in a harsh voice, “Jimmy is
my name, and I want to hear no other, if you
please.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding, used as he was to the wayward
phases of men, was a little startled at the effect of
his words, and hastened to atone for his blunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“I—I beg your pardon,” he said quickly. “I
merely wished to say——”</p>

<p>Jimmy did not wait to hear what he said, but
turned upon Connor.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a few words to say to you,” he said.
His voice had gone back to its calm level, but
there was a menace in its quietness.</p>

<p>“When I persuaded Angel to give you a chance
to get away on the night the ‘Borough Lot’ was
arrested, I hoped I could get you to agree with
me that the money should be handed to Miss
Kent when the word was found. I knew in my
inmost heart that this was a forlorn hope,” he
went on, “that there is no gold in the quartz of
your composition. You are just beast all
through.”</p>

<p>He paced the floor of the hall for a minute or
two, then he stopped.</p>

<p>“Connor,” he said suddenly, “you tried to
take my life the other night. I have a mind to
retaliate. You may go ahead and puzzle out the
word that unlocks that safe. Get it by any means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
that suggest themselves to you. Steal it, buy it—do
anything you wish. The day you secure the
key to Reale’s treasure I shall kill you.”</p>

<p>He talked like a man propounding a simple
business proposition, and the lawyer, who in his
early youth had written a heavy little paper
on “The Congenital Criminal,” listened and
watched, and, in quite a respectable way,
gloated.</p>

<p>Jimmy picked up his hat and coat from a chair,
and nodding to the lawyer, strolled out of the hall.</p>

<p>In the vestibule where the one commissionaire
had been were six. Every man was a non-commissioned
officer, and, as was apparent from his
medals, had seen war service. Jimmy noted the
belt about each man and the dangling revolver
holster, and approved of the lawyer’s precaution.</p>

<p>“Night guard, sergeant-major?” he asked, addressing
one whose crowned sleeve showed his
rank.</p>

<p>“Day and night guard, sir,” replied the officer
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Good,” said Jimmy, and passed out into the
street.</p>

<p>And now only the lawyer and Connor remained,
and as Jimmy left, they too prepared
for departure.</p>

<p>The lawyer was mildly interested in the big,
heavy criminal who walked by his side. He was
a fairly familiar type of the bull-headed desperado.</p>

<p>“There is nothing I can explain?” asked Spedding,
as they stood together in the vestibule.</p>

<p>Connor’s eyes were on the guard, and he
frowned a little.</p>

<p>“You don’t trust us very much,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t trust you at all,” said the lawyer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THE RED ENVELOPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Spedding</span>, the admirable lawyer, lived on
Clapham Common, where he owned the freehold
of that desirable residence, “High Holly Lodge.”</p>

<p>He was a bachelor, with a taste for bridge
parties and Madeira. Curious neighbors would
have been mystified if they had known that Mr.
Spedding’s repair bill during the first two years
of his residence was something well over three
thousand pounds. What they <i>did</i> know was that
Mr. Spedding “had the builders in” for an unconscionable
time, that they were men who spoke
in a language entirely foreign to Clapham, and
that they were housed during the period of renovation
in a little galvanized iron bungalow erected
for the purpose in the grounds.</p>

<p>A neighbor on visiting terms expressed his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
opinion that for all the workmen had done he
could discern no material difference in the structure
of the house, and from his point of view the
house presented the same appearance after the
foreign builders left, as it did before their advent.
Mr. Spedding met all carelessly-applied questions
concerning the extent of the structural alterations
with supreme discretion. He spoke vaguely
about a new system of ventilation, and hinted at
warmth by radiation.</p>

<p>Suburbia loves to show off its privately conceived
improvements to property, but Mr. Spedding
met veiled hints of a desire to inspect his
work with that comfortable smile which was so
valuable an asset of his business.</p>

<p>It was a few evenings after the scene in the
Lombard Street Deposit that Mr. Spedding sat in
solitude before his modest dinner at Clapham.</p>

<p>An evening newspaper lay by the side of his
chair, and he picked it up at intervals to read
again the paragraph which told of the release of
the “Borough Lot.” The paragraph read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“The men arrested in connection with the
gambling raid at Poplar were discharged to-day,
the police, it is understood, failing to
secure sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution.”</p>
</div>

<p>The lawyer shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I rather like Angel Esquire’s definition,” he
said with a wry smile. “It is a neat method
of saving the face of the police, but I
could wish that the ‘Borough Lot’ were out of
the way.”</p>

<p>Later he had occasion to change his opinion.</p>

<p>A tap at the door preceded the entry of a sedate
butler. The lawyer looked at the card on the
tray, and hesitated; then, “Show him in,” he
said.</p>

<p>Jimmy came into the room, and bowed slightly
to the elder man, who rose at his entrance.</p>

<p>They waited in silence till the servant had
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“To what am I indebted?” began the lawyer,
and motioned his visitor to a seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“May I smoke?” asked Jimmy, and Mr. Spedding nodded.</p>

<p>“It is in the matter of Reale’s millions,” said
Jimmy, and allowed his eyes to follow the cloud
of smoke he blew.</p>

<p>“I thought it was understood that this was a
subject which might only be discussed at my office
and in business hours?” said the lawyer sharply,
and Jimmy nodded again.</p>

<p>“You will confess, Mr. Spedding,” he said
easily, “that the Reale will is sufficiently unconventional
to justify any departure from established
custom on the part of the fortunate or unfortunate
legatees.”</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding made an impatient movement of
his hand.</p>

<p>“I do not inquire into your business,” Jimmy
went on smoothly enough, “and I am wholly incurious
as to in what strange manner you became
acquainted with your late client, or what fees you
received to undertake so extraordinary a commission;
but I am satisfied that you are recompensed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
for such trifling inconveniences as—say an after-dinner
visit from myself.”</p>

<p>Jimmy had a way of choosing his words, hesitating
for the exact expression that would best
convey every shade of his meaning. The lawyer,
too, recognized the logic of the speech, and
contented himself with a shrug which meant
nothing.</p>

<p>“I do not inquire into your motives,” Jimmy
resumed; “it pleases me to believe that they are
entirely disinterested, that your attitude is the
ideal one as between client and agent.”</p>

<p>His pause was longer this time, and the lawyer
was piqued into interjecting an impatient—</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jimmy slowly, “believing all this,
let us say, I am at a loss to know why at the reading
of the will you gave us no indication of the
existence of a key to this mysterious verse.”</p>

<p>“There is no key,” said the lawyer quickly,
and added, “so far as I know.”</p>

<p>“That you did not tell us,” Jimmy went on, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
though unconscious of any interruption, “of the
big red envelope——”</p>

<p>Spedding sprang to his feet white as death.</p>

<p>“The envelope,” he stammered angrily, “what
do you know—what envelope?”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s hand waved him to his seat.</p>

<p>“Let us have no emotions, no flights, no outraged
honor, I beg of you, dear Mr. Spedding. I
do not suggest that you have any sinister reasons
for withholding information concerning what my
friend Angel would call the ‘surprise packet.’ In
good time I do not doubt you would have disclosed
its existence.”</p>

<p>“I know of no red envelope,” said the lawyer
doggedly.</p>

<p>“I rather fancied you would say that,” said
Jimmy, with a touch of admiration in his tone.
“You are not the sort of fox to curl up and howl
at the first bay of the hound—if you will permit
the simile—indeed, you would have disappointed
me if you had.”</p>

<p>The lawyer paced the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Look here,” he said, coming to a halt before
the semi-recumbent form that lay behind a haze
of cigarette smoke in the arm-chair, “you’ve
spent a great deal of your time telling me what I
am, describing my many doubtful qualities, and
hinting more or less broadly that I am a fairly
representative scoundrel. May I ask what is
your ultimate object? Is it blackmail?” he demanded
harshly.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jimmy, by no means disconcerted
by the brutality of the question.</p>

<p>“Are you begging, or borrowing, or——”</p>

<p>“Stealing?” murmured Jimmy lazily.</p>

<p>“All that I have to say to you is, finish your
business and go. Furthermore, you are at liberty
to come with me to-morrow morning and search
my office and question my clerks. I will accompany
you to my banks, and to the strong-room I
rent at the deposit. Search for this red envelope
you speak about, and if you find it, you are
at liberty to draw the worst deductions you
will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>Jimmy pulled gently at his cigarette with reflective
eyes cast upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Do you speak Spanish?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said the other impatiently.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity,” said Jimmy, with a note of genuine
regret. “Spanish is a very useful language—especially
in the Argentine, for which delightful
country, I understand, lawyers who betray
their trust have an especial predilection. My
Spanish needs a little furbishing, and only the
other day I was practising with a man whose
name, I believe, is Murrello. Do you know
him?”</p>

<p>“If you have completed your business, I will
ring for the servant,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>“He told me—my Spaniard, I mean—a curious
story. He comes from Barcelona, and by
way of being a mason or something of the sort,
was brought to England with some other of his
fellow-countrymen to make some curious alterations
to the house of a Señor in—er—Clapham
of all places in the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>The lawyer’s breath came short and fast.</p>

<p>“From what I was able to gather,” Jimmy
went on languidly, “and my Spanish is Andalusian
rather than Catalonian, so that I missed some
of his interesting narrative, these alterations partook
of the nature of wonderfully concealed
strong-rooms—steel doors artfully covered with
cheap wood carving, vaults cunningly constructed
beneath innocent basement kitchens, little stairways
in apparently solid walls and the
like.”</p>

<p>The levity went out of his voice, and he
straightened himself in his chair.</p>

<p>“I have no desire to search your office,” he
said quietly, “or perhaps I should say no further
desire, for I have already methodically examined
every hole and corner. No,” he checked the
words on Spedding’s lips, “no, it was not I who
committed the blundering burglary you spoke of.
You never found traces of me, I’ll swear. You
may keep the keys of your strong-room, and I
shall not trouble your bankers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“What do you want?” demanded the lawyer
shortly.</p>

<p>“I want to see what you have got downstairs,”
was the reply, and there was no doubting its
earnestness, “and more especially do I want to
see the red envelope.”</p>

<p>The lawyer bent his brows in thought. His
eyes were fixed unwaveringly on Jimmy’s.</p>

<p>“Suppose,” he said slowly, “suppose that such
an envelope did exist, suppose for the sake of
argument these mysterious vaults and secret
chambers are, as you suggest, in existence, what
right have you, more than any other one of the
beneficiaries under the will, to demand a private
examination? Why should I give you an unfair
advantage over them?”</p>

<p>Jimmy rose to his feet and stretched himself
before replying.</p>

<p>“There is only one legatee whom I recognize,”
he said briefly, “that is the girl. The money is
hers. I do not want a farthing. I am equally
determined that nobody else shall touch a penny—neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
my young friend Connor”—he stopped
to give emphasis to the next two words—“nor
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Sir!” said the outraged Mr. Spedding.</p>

<p>“Nor yourself, Mr. Spedding,” repeated
Jimmy with conviction. “Let us understand
each other thoroughly. You are, as I read you,
a fairly respectable citizen. I would trust you
with ten or a hundred thousand pounds without
experiencing the slightest anxiety. I would not
trust you with two millions in solid cash, nor
would I trust any man. The magnitude of the
sum is calculated to overwhelm your moral sense.
The sooner the red envelope is in the possession
of Angel Esquire the better for us all.”</p>

<p>Spedding stood with bent head, his fingers
nervously stroking his jaw, thinking.</p>

<p>“An agile mind this,” thought Jimmy; “if I
am not careful there will be trouble here.”</p>

<p>He watched the lawyer’s face, and noticed the
lines suddenly disappear from the troubled face,
and the placid smile returning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Conciliation and partial confession,” judged
Jimmy, and his diagnosis was correct.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Jimmy,” said Spedding, with some
show of heartiness, “since you know so much, it
may be as well to tell you more. As you have so
cleverly discovered, my house to a great extent is
a strong-room. There are many valuable documents
that I could not with any confidence leave
deposited at my office. They are safer here under
my eye, so to speak. The papers of the late Mr.
Reale are, I confess, in this house; but—now
mark me—whether the red envelope you speak of
is amongst these I do not know. There is a multitude
of documents in connection with the case,
all of which I have had no time to go through.
The hour is late, but——”</p>

<p>He paused irresolutely.</p>

<p>“——If you would care to inspect the mysteries
of the basement”—he smiled benevolently, and
was his old self—“I shall be happy to have your
assistance in a cursory search.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was alert and watchful and to the point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Lead the way,” he said shortly, and Spedding,
after a moment’s hesitation, opened the door
and Jimmy followed him into the hall.</p>

<p>Contrary to his expectations, the lawyer led
him upstairs, and through a plainly furnished bedroom
to a small dressing-room that opened off.
There was a conventional wardrobe against the
wall, and this Spedding opened. A dozen suits
hung from hooks and stretchers, and the lawyer
groped amongst these for a moment. Then there
was a soft click, and the back of the wardrobe
swung back.</p>

<p>Spedding turned to his visitor with a quizzical
smile.</p>

<p>“Your friend Angel’s method of gaining admittance
to the haunt of the ‘Borough Lot’ was
not original. Come.”</p>

<p>Jimmy stepped gingerly through into the darkness.
He heard the snap of a button, and a soft
glow of light revealed a tiny chamber, in which
two men might comfortably stand upright. The
back of the wardrobe closed, and they were alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
in a little room about as large as an average cupboard.</p>

<p>There was a steel lever on one side of the walls,
and this the lawyer pulled cautiously. Jimmy
felt a sinking sensation, and heard a faint, far-off
buzzing of machinery.</p>

<p>“An electric lift, I take it,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>“An electric lift,” repeated the lawyer.</p>

<p>Down, down, down they sank, till Jimmy calculated
that they must be at least twenty feet
below the street level. Then the lift slowed down
and stopped at a door. Spedding opened this
with a key he took from his pocket, and they
stepped out into a chill, earthy darkness.</p>

<p>“There’s a light here,” said the lawyer, and
groped for the switch.</p>

<p>They were in a large vaulted apartment lit from
the roof. At one end a steel door faced them,
and ranged about the vault on iron racks a number
of black japanned boxes.</p>

<p>Jimmy noted the inscriptions, and was a little
surprised at the extent and importance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
solicitor’s practice. Spedding must have read his
thoughts, for he turned with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not particularly suggestive of a defaulting
solicitor,” he said ironically.</p>

<p>“Two million pounds,” replied Jimmy immediately,
“that is my answer to you, Mr. Spedding.
An enormous fortune for the reaching. I
wouldn’t trust the Governors of the Bank of
England.”</p>

<p>Spedding may have been annoyed as he walked
to the door in the wall and opened it, but he
effectively concealed his annoyance.</p>

<p>As the door fell backward, Jimmy saw a little
apartment, four feet by six feet, with a roof he
could touch with his hand. There was a fresh
current of air, but from whence it came he could
not discover. The only articles of furniture in
the little cell were a writing table and a swing
chair placed exactly beneath the electric lamp in
the roof.</p>

<p>Spedding pulled open a drawer in the
desk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“I do not keep my desks locked here,” he said
pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of him that he indulged in
no preamble, no apologetic preliminaries, and that
he showed no sign of embarrassment as he slipped
his hand into the drawer, and drawing forth a
bulky red envelope, threw it on to the desk.</p>

<p>You might have forgotten that his last words
were denials that the red envelope had existed.
Jimmy looked at him curiously, and the lawyer
returned his gaze.</p>

<p>“A new type?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Jimmy cheerfully. “I once
knew a man like you in the Argentine—he was
hanged eventually.”</p>

<p>“Curious,” mused the lawyer, “I have often
thought I might be hanged, but have never quite
seen why——” He nearly added something
else, but checked himself.</p>

<p>Jimmy had the red envelope in his hand and
was examining it closely. It was heavily sealed
with the lawyer’s own seal, and bore the inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
in Reale’s crabbed, illiterate handwriting,
“Puzzle Ideas.” He weighed it and pinched it.
There was a little compact packet inside.</p>

<p>“I shall open this,” said Jimmy decisively.
“You, of course, have already examined it.”</p>

<p>The lawyer made no reply.</p>

<p>Jimmy broke the seal of the envelope. Half
his mind was busy in speculation as to its contents,
the other half was engaged with the lawyer’s
plans. Jimmy was too experienced a man
to be deceived by the complaisance of the smooth
Mr. Spedding. He watched his every move. All
the while he was engaged in what appeared to be
a concentrated examination of the packet his eyes
never left the lawyer. That Spedding made no
sign was a further proof in Jimmy’s eyes that the
coup was to come.</p>

<p>“We might as well examine the envelope upstairs
as here,” said the lawyer. The other man
nodded, and followed him from the cell. Spedding
closed the steel door and locked it, then
turned to Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Do you notice,” he said with some satisfaction,
“how skilfully this chamber is constructed?”
He waved his hand round the larger
vault, at the iron racks and the shiny black boxes.</p>

<p>Jimmy was alert now. The lawyer’s geniality
was too gratuitous, his remarks a trifle inapropos.
It was like the lame introduction to a story which
the teller was anxious to drag in at all hazards.</p>

<p>“Here, for instance,” said the lawyer, tapping
one of the boxes, “is what appears to be an
ordinary deed box. As a matter of fact, it is an
ingenious device for trapping burglars, if they
should by any chance reach the vault. It is not
opened by an ordinary key, but by the pressure
of a button, either in my room or here.”</p>

<p>He walked leisurely to the end of the vault,
Jimmy following.</p>

<p>For a man of his build Spedding was a remarkably
agile man. Jimmy had underrated his
agility.</p>

<p>He realized this when suddenly the lights went
out. Jimmy sprang for the lawyer, and struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
the rough stone wall of the vault. He groped
quickly left and right, and grasped only the air.</p>

<p>“Keep quiet,” commanded Spedding’s calm
voice from the other end of the chamber, “and
keep cool. I am going to show you my burglar
catcher.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s fingers were feeling along the wall for
the switch that controlled the lights. As if divining
his intention, the lawyer’s voice said—</p>

<p>“The lights are out of control, Jimmy, and I
am fairly well out of your reach.”</p>

<p>“We shall see,” was Jimmy’s even reply.</p>

<p>“And if you start shooting you will only make
the atmosphere of this place a little more unbreathable
than it is at present,” Spedding went
on.</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled in the darkness, and the lawyer
heard the snap of a Colt pistol as his captive
loaded.</p>

<p>“Did you notice the little ventilator?” asked
the lawyer’s voice again. “Well, I am behind
that. Between my unworthy body and your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
nickel bullets there are two feet of solid
masonry.”</p>

<p>Jimmy made no reply, his pistol went back to
his hip again. He had his electric lamp in his
pocket, but prudently kept it there.</p>

<p>“Before we go any further,” he said slowly,
“will you be good enough to inform me as to
your intentions?”</p>

<p>He wanted three minutes, he wanted them very
badly; perhaps two minutes would be enough. All
the time the lawyer was speaking he was actively
employed. He had kicked off his shoes when the
lights went out, and now he stole round the room,
his sensitive hands flying over the stony walls.</p>

<p>“As to my intentions,” the lawyer was saying,
“it must be fairly obvious to you that I am not
going to hand you over to the police. Rather, my
young friend, in the vulgar parlance of the criminal
classes, I am going to ‘do you in,’ meaning
thereby, if you will forgive the legal terminology,
that I shall assist you to another and, I hope,
though I am not sanguine, a better world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>He heard Jimmy’s insolent laugh in the blackness.</p>

<p>“You are a man after my own heart, Jimmy,”
he went on regretfully. “I could have wished
that I might have been spared this painful duty;
but it is a duty, one that I owe to society and
myself.”</p>

<p>“You are an amusing person,” said Jimmy’s
voice.</p>

<p>“I am glad you think so. Jimmy, my young
friend, I am afraid our conversation must end
here. Do you know anything of chemistry?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Then you will appreciate my burglar catcher,”
said Spedding, with uncanny satisfaction. “You,
perhaps, noticed the japanned box with the perforated
lid? You did? Good! There are two
compartments, and two chemicals in certain
quantities kept apart. My hand is on the key now
that will combine them. When cyanide of potassium
is combined with sulphuric acid, do you
know what gas is formed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Jimmy did not reply. He had found what he
had been searching for. His talk with the Spanish
builder had been to some purpose. It was a
little stony projection from the wall. He pressed
it downward, and was sensible of a sensation of
coldness. He reached out his hand, and found
where solid wall had been a blank space.</p>

<p>“Do you hear, Jimmy?” asked the lawyer’s
voice.</p>

<p>“I hear,” replied Jimmy, and felt for the edge
of the secret door. His fingers sliding down the
smooth surface of the flange encountered the two
catches.</p>

<p>“It is hydrocyanic acid,” said the lawyer’s
smooth voice, and Jimmy heard the snap of the
button.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said the lawyer’s voice again, and
Jimmy reeled back through the open doorway
swinging the door behind him, and carrying with
him a whiff of air heavily laden with the scent
of almonds.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>WHAT THE RED ENVELOPE HELD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My</span> dear Angel,” wrote Jimmy, “I commend
to you one Mr. Spedding, an ingenious man.
If by chance you ever wish to visit him, do so in
business hours. If you desire to examine his
most secret possession, effect an entrance into a
dreary-looking house at the corner of Cley’s Road,
a stone’s-throw from ‘High Holly Lodge.’ It
is marked in plain characters ‘To Let.’ In the
basement you will find a coal-cellar. Searching
the coal-cellar diligently, you will discover a flight
of stone steps leading to a subterranean passage,
which burrows under the ground until it arrives
at friend Spedding’s particular private vault. If
this reads like a leaf torn from Dumas or dear
Harrison Ainsworth it is not my fault. I visited
our legal adviser last night, and had quite a thrilling
evening. That I am alive this morning is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
a tribute to my caution and foreseeing wisdom.
The result of my visit is this: I have the key of
the ‘safe-word’ in my hands. Come and get it.”</p>

<p>Angel found the message awaiting him when
he reached Scotland Yard that morning. He too
had spent sleepless hours in a futile attempt to
unravel the mystery of old Reale’s doggerel verse.</p>

<p>A telegram brought Kathleen Kent to town.
Angel met her at a quiet restaurant in Rupert
Street, and was struck by the delicate beauty of
this slim girl with the calm, gray eyes.</p>

<p>She greeted him with a sad little smile.</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would never see me again
after my outburst of the other night,” she said.
“This—this—person is a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“Jimmy?” asked the detective cheerily. “Oh,
yes, Jimmy’s by way of being a friend; but he
deserved all you said, and he knows it, Miss
Kent.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face darkened momentarily as she
thought of Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I shall never understand,” she said slowly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
“how a man of his gifts allowed himself to become——”</p>

<p>“But,” protested the detective, “he told you
he took no part in the decoying of your father.”</p>

<p>The girl turned with open-eyed astonishment.</p>

<p>“Surely you do not expect me to believe his
excuses,” she cried.</p>

<p>Angel Esquire looked grave.</p>

<p>“That is just what I should ask you to believe,”
he said quietly. “Jimmy makes no excuses, and
he would certainly tell no lie in extenuation of
his faults.”</p>

<p>“But—but,” said Kathleen, bewildered, “he is
a thief by his own showing—a bad man.”</p>

<p>“A thief,” said Angel soberly, “but not a bad
man. Jimmy is a puzzle to most people. To me
he is perfectly understandable; that is because I
have too much of the criminal in my own composition,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>“I wish, oh, how I wish I had your faith in
him! Then I could absolve him from suspicion
of having helped ruin my poor father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“I think you can do that,” said the detective
almost eagerly. “Believe me, Jimmy is not to be
judged by conventional standards. If you ask
me to describe him, I would say that he is a genius
who works in an eccentric circle that sometimes
overlaps, sometimes underreaches the rigid circle
of the law. If you asked me as a policeman, and
if I was his bitterest enemy, what I could do with
Jimmy, I should say, ‘Nothing.’ I know of no
crime with which I could charge him, save at
times with associating with doubtful characters.
As a matter of fact, that equally applies to me.
Listen, Miss Kent. The first big international
case I figured in was a gigantic fraud on the
Egyptian Bank. Some four hundred thousand
pounds were involved, and whilst from the outsider’s
point of view Jimmy was beyond suspicion,
yet we who were working at the case suspected
him, and pretty strongly. The men who owned
the bank were rich Egyptians, and the head of all
was a Somebody-or-other Pasha, as great a scoundrel
as ever drew breath. It is impossible to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
a lady exactly how big a scoundrel he was, but
you may guess. Well, the Pasha knew it was
Jimmy who had done the trick, and we knew, but
we dare not say so. The arrest of Jimmy would
have automatically ruined the banker. That was
where I realized the kind of man I had to deal
with, and I am always prepared when Jimmy’s
name is mentioned in connection with a big crime
to discover that his victim deserved all he got,
and a little more.”</p>

<p>The girl gave a little shiver.</p>

<p>“It sounds dreadful. Cannot such a man as
that employ his talents to a greater advantage?”</p>

<p>Angel shrugged his shoulders despairingly.</p>

<p>“I’ve given up worrying about misapplied
talents; it is a subject that touches me too
closely,” he said. “But as to Jimmy, I’m rather
glad you started the conversation in that direction,
because I’m going to ask you to meet him
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I couldn’t,” she began.</p>

<p>“You are thinking of what happened on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
night the will was read? Well, you must forget
that. Jimmy has the key to the verse, and it is
absolutely imperative that you should be present
this afternoon.”</p>

<p>With some demur, she consented.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the sitting-room of Jimmy’s flat the three
sat round a table littered with odds and ends of
papers.</p>

<p>The girl had met him with some trepidation,
and his distant bow had done more to assure her
than had he displayed a desire to rehabilitate himself
in her good opinion.</p>

<p>Without any preliminaries, Jimmy showed the
contents of the packet. He did not explain to
the girl by what means he had come into possession
of them.</p>

<p>“Of all these papers,” began Jimmy, tapping
the letter before him, “only one is of any service,
and even that makes confusion worse confounded.
Reale had evidently had this cursed cryptogram
in his mind for a long time. He had made many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
experiments, and rejected many. Here is
one.”</p>

<p>He pushed over a card, which bore a few words
in Reale’s characteristic hand.</p>

<p>Angel read:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>“The word of five letters I will use, namely:</p>

<p>1. White every 24 sec.<br>
2. Fixed white and red.<br>
3. White group two every 30 sec.<br>
4. Group occ. white red sec. 30 sec.<br>
5. Fixed white and red.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Underneath was written: “No good; too
easy.”</p>

<p>The detective’s brows were bent in perplexity.</p>

<p>“I’m blessed if I can see where the easiness
comes in,” he said. “To me it seems so much
gibberish, and as difficult as the other.”</p>

<p>Jimmy noted the detective’s bewilderment with
a quiet smile of satisfaction. He did not look
directly at the girl, but out of the corner of his
eyes he could see her eager young face bent over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the card, her pretty forehead wrinkled in a despairing
attempt to decipher the curious document.</p>

<p>“Yet it was easy,” he said, “and if Reale had
stuck to that word, the safe would have been
opened by now.”</p>

<p>Angel pored over the mysterious clue.</p>

<p>“The word, as far as I can gather,” said
Jimmy, “is ‘smock,’ but it may be——”</p>

<p>“How on earth——” began Angel in amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s easy,” said Jimmy cheerfully, “and
I am surprised that an old traveler like yourself
should have missed it.”</p>

<p>“Group occ. white red sec. 30 sec.,” read
Angel.</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed.</p>

<p>It was the first time the girl had seen this
strange man throw aside his habitual restraint,
and she noted with an unaccountable satisfaction
that he was decidedly handsome when
amused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Let me translate it for you,” said Jimmy.
“Let me expand it into, ‘Group occulting White
with Red Sectors every Thirty Seconds.’ Now
do you understand?”</p>

<p>Angel shook his head.</p>

<p>“You may think I am shockingly dense,” he
said frankly, “but even with your lucid explanation
I am still in the dark.”</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled.</p>

<p>“Suppose you went to Dover to-night, and sat
at the end of the Admiralty Pier. It is a beautiful
night, with stars in the sky, and you are looking
toward France, and you see——?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Angel slowly; “a few ships’
lights, perhaps, and the flash of the Calais Lighthouse——”</p>

<p>“The occulting flash?” suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>“The occ.! By Jove!”</p>

<p>“Glad you see it,” said Jimmy briskly. “What
old Reale did was to take the names of five
famous lights—any nautical almanac will give
you them:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>Sanda.<br>
Milford Haven.<br>
Orkneys.<br>
Caldy Island.<br>
Kinnaird Head.</p>
</div></div>

<p>They form an acrostic, and the initial letters form
the work ‘smock’; but it was too easy—and too
hard, because there are two or three lights, particularly
the fixed lights, that are exactly the
same, so he dropped <i>that</i> idea.”</p>

<p>Angel breathed an admiring sigh.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, you’re a wonder,” he said
simply.</p>

<p>Jimmy, busying himself amongst the papers,
stole a glance at the girl.</p>

<p>“I am very human,” he thought, and was annoyed
at the discovery.</p>

<p>“Now we come to the more important clue,”
he said, and smoothed a crumpled paper on the
table.</p>

<p>“This, I believe, to have a direct bearing on the
verse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>Then three heads came close together over the
scrawled sheet.</p>

<p>“A picture of a duck, which means T,” spelt
Angel, “and that’s erased; and then it is a snake
that means T——”</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded.</p>

<p>“In Reale’s verse,” he said deliberately, “there
are six words; outside of those six words I am
convinced the verse has no meaning. Six words
strung together, and each word in capitals.
Listen.”</p>

<p>He took from his pocketbook the familiar slip
on which the verse was written:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Here’s a puzzle in language old,</div>
<div class="verse">Find my meaning and get my gold.</div>
<div class="verse">Take one BOLT—just one, no more—</div>
<div class="verse">Fix it on behind a DOOR.</div>
<div class="verse">Place it at a river’s MOUTH</div>
<div class="verse">East or west or north or south.</div>
<div class="verse">Take some LEAVES and put them whole</div>
<div class="verse">In some WATER in a BOWL.</div>
<div class="verse">I found this puzzle in a book</div>
<div class="verse">From which some mighty truths were took.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“There are six words,” said Jimmy, and
scribbled them down as he spoke:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<table>
<tr><td>“Bolt (or Bolts). &#160; &#160;</td><td>Leave (or Leaves).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Door.</td><td>                   Water.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mouth.</td><td>                  Bowl.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each one stands for a letter—but what letter?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather hopeless if the old man has
searched round for all sorts of out-of-the-way
objects, and allowed them to stand for letters of
the alphabet,” said Angel.</p>

<p>The girl murmured something, and met
Jimmy’s inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>“I was only saying,” she said hesitatingly,
“that there seems to be a method in all this.”</p>

<p>“Except,” said Jimmy, “for this,” and he
pointed to the crossed-out duck. “By that it
would seem that Reale chose his symbols haphazard,
and that the duck not pleasing him, he
substituted the snake.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Kathleen, addressing Angel,
“doesn’t it seem strange that an illiterate man like
Mr. Reale should make even these rough sketches
unless he had a model to draw from?”</p>

<p>“Miss Kent is right,” said Jimmy quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“And,” she went on, gaining confidence as she
spoke, “is there not something about these drawings
that reminds you of something?”</p>

<p>“Of what?” asked Angel.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell,” she replied, shaking her head;
“and yet they remind me of something, and
worry me, just as a bar of music that I cannot
play worries me. I feel sure that I have seen
them before, that they form a part of some system——”
She stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>“I know,” she continued in a lower voice;
“they are associated in my mind—with—with
the Bible.”</p>

<p>The two men stared at her in blank astonishment.
Then Jimmy sprang to his feet, alight
with excitement.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he cried. “Angel, don’t you see?
The last two lines of Reale’s doggerel—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘I found this puzzle in a book</div>
<div class="verse">From which some mighty truths were took.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Go on, go on, Miss Kent,” cried Angel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
eagerly. “You are on the right track. Try to
think——”</p>

<p>Kathleen hesitated, then turned to Jimmy to
address the first remark she had directed to him
personally that day.</p>

<p>“You haven’t got——?”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s smile was a little hard.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to disappoint you, Miss Kent, but I
<i>have</i> got a copy,” he said, with a touch of bitterness
in his tone. He walked to the bookcase at
one end of the room and reached down the book—a
well-worn volume—and placed it before
her.</p>

<p>The rebuke in his voice was deserved, she felt
that.</p>

<p>She turned the leaves over quickly, but inspiration
seemed to have died, for there was nothing in
the sacred volume that marshaled her struggling
thoughts.</p>

<p>“Is it a text?” asked Angel.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“It is—something,” she said. “That sounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
vague, doesn’t it? I thought if I had the book
in my hand, it would recall everything.”</p>

<p>Angel was intently studying the rebus.</p>

<p>“Here’s one letter, anyway. You said that,
Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“The door?” said Jimmy. “Yes, that’s
fairly evident. Whatever the word is, its second
letter is ‘P.’ You see Reale’s scribbled notes?
All these are no good, the other letters are best, I
suppose it means; so we can cut out ‘T,’ ‘O,’ and
‘K.’”</p>

<p>“The best clue of all,” he went on, “is the
notes about the ‘professor.’ You see them:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Mem.: To get the professor’s new book on it.</div>
<div class="verse">Mem.: To do what the professor thinks right.</div>
<div class="verse">Mem.: To write to professor about——’</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now the questions are: Who is the professor,
what is his book, and what did he advise? Reale
was in correspondence with him, that is certain;
in his desire for accuracy, Reale sought his advice.
In all these papers there is no trace of a letter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
if any book exists it is still in Sped—it is still in
the place from whence this red envelope came.”</p>

<p>The two men exchanged a swift glance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Angel, as if answering the other’s
unspoken thought, “it might be done.”</p>

<p>The girl looked from one to the other in doubt.</p>

<p>“Does this mean an extra risk?” she asked
quietly. “I have not questioned you as to how
this red envelope came into your possession, but I
have a feeling that it was not obtained without
danger.”</p>

<p>Angel disregarded Jimmy’s warning frown.
He was determined that the better side of his
strange friend’s character should be made evident
to the girl.</p>

<p>“Jimmy faced death in a particularly unpleasant
form to secure the packet, Miss Kent,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Then I forbid any further risk,” she said
spiritedly. “I thought I had made it clear that I
would not accept favors at your friend’s hands;
least of all do I want the favor of his life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Jimmy heard her unmoved. He had a bitter
tongue when he so willed, and he chose that
moment.</p>

<p>“I do not think you can too strongly impress
upon Miss Kent the fact that I am an interested
party in this matter,” he said acidly. “As she
refused my offer to forego my claim to a share of
the fortune, she might remember that my interest
in the legacy is at least as great as hers. I am
risking what I risk, not so much from the beautifully
quixotic motives with which she doubtless
credits me, as from a natural desire to help myself.”</p>

<p>She winced a little at the bluntness of his
speech; then recognizing she was in the wrong,
she grew angry with herself at her indiscretion.</p>

<p>“If the book is—where these papers were, it
can be secured,” Jimmy continued, regaining his
suavity. “If the professor is still alive he will
be found, and by to-morrow I shall have in my
possession a list of every book that has ever been
written by a professor of anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Some thought tickled him, and he laughed for
the second time that afternoon.</p>

<p>“There’s a fine course of reading for us all,”
he said with a little chuckle. “Heaven knows
into what mysterious regions the literary professor
will lead us. I know one professor who has
written a treatise on Sociology that runs into ten
volumes, and another who has spoken his mind
on Inductive Logic to the extent of twelve hundred
closely-printed pages. I have in my mind’s
eye a vision of three people sitting amidst a chaos
of thoughtful literature, searching ponderous
tomes for esoteric references to bolts, door,
mouth, et cetera.”</p>

<p>The picture he drew was too much for the
gravity of the girl, and her friendship with the
man who was professedly a thief, and by inference
something worse, began with a ripple of
laughter that greeted his sally.</p>

<p>Jimmy gathered up the papers, and carefully
replaced them in the envelope. This he handed
to Angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Place this amongst the archives,” he said
flippantly.</p>

<p>“Why not keep it here?” asked Angel in surprise.</p>

<p>Jimmy walked to one of the three French
windows that opened on to a small balcony. He
took a rapid survey of the street, then beckoned
to Angel.</p>

<p>“Do you see that man?” He pointed to a
lounger sauntering along on the opposite sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Jimmy walked back to the center of the room.</p>

<p>“That’s why,” he said simply. “There will
be a burglary here to-night or to-morrow night.
People aren’t going to let a fortune slip through
their fingers without making some kind of effort
to save it.”</p>

<p>“What people?” demanded the girl. “You
mean those dreadful men who took me away?”</p>

<p>“That is very possible,” said Jimmy, “although
I was thinking of somebody else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>The girl had put on her wrap, and stood irresolutely
near the door, and Angel was waiting.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” she said hesitatingly. “I—I am
afraid I have done you an injustice, and—and I
want to thank you for all you have undergone for
me. I know—I feel that I have been ungracious,
and——”</p>

<p>“You have done me no injustice,” said Jimmy
in a low voice. “I am all that you thought I
was—and worse.”</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him, and he raised it
to his lips, which was unlike Jimmy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>OLD GEORGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A stranger</span> making a call in that portion of
North Kensington which lies in the vicinity of
Ladbroke Grove by some mischance lost his way.
He wandered through many prosperous crescents
and quiet squares redolent of the opulence of the
upper middle classes, through broad avenues
where neat broughams stood waiting in small carriage-drives,
and once he blundered into a tidy
mews, where horsy men with great hissings made
ready the chariots of the Notting Hill plutocracy.
It may be that he was in no particular hurry to
arrive at his destination, this stranger—who has
nothing to do with the story—but certainly he
did not avail himself of opportunity in the shape
of a passing policeman, and continued his aimless
wanderings. He found Kensington Park Road,
a broad thoroughfare of huge gardens and walled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
forecourts, then turned into a side street. He
walked about twenty paces, and found himself in
the heart of slum-land.</p>

<p>It is no ordinary slum this little patch of property
that lies between Westbourne Grove and
Kensington Park Road. There are no tumbled-down
hovels or noisome passages; there are
streets of houses dignified with flights of steps
that rise to pretentious street doors and areas
where long dead menials served the need of the
lower middle classes of other days. The streets
are given over to an army of squalling children in
varying styles of dirtiness, and the halls of these
houses are bare of carpet or covering, and in some
the responsibility of leasehold is shared by eight
or nine families, all pigging together.</p>

<p>They are streets of slatternly women, who live
at their front doors, arms rolled under discolored
aprons, and on Saturday nights one street at least
deserves the pithy but profane appellation which
the police have given it—“Little Hell.”</p>

<p>In this particular thoroughfare it is held that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
all sins the greatest is that which is associated
with “spying.” A “spy” is a fairly comprehensive
phrase in Cawdor Street. It may mean
policeman, detective, school-board official, rent
collector, or the gentleman appointed by the gas
company to extract pennies from the slot-meters.</p>

<p>To Cawdor Street came a man who rented one
of the larger houses. To the surprise of the
agent, he offered his rent monthly in advance; to
the surprise of the street, he took no lodgers. It
was the only detached house in that salubrious
road, and was No. 49. The furniture came by
night, which is customary amongst people who
concentrate their last fluttering rag of pride upon
the respectability of their household goods. Cawdor
Street, on the <i>qui vive</i> for the lady of the
house, learns with genuine astonishment that
there was none, and that the newcomer was a
bachelor.</p>

<p>Years ago No. 49 had been the abode of a jobbing
builder, hence the little yard gate that flanked
one side; and it was with satisfaction that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
Cawdor Streeters discovered that the new occupant
intended reviving the ancient splendor of the
establishment. At any rate, a board was prominently
displayed, bearing the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">J. JONES, BUILDER AND CONTRACTOR.</p>

<p>and the inquisitive Mr. Lane (of 76), who caught
a momentary vision of the yard through the gate,
observed “Office” printed in fairly large letters
over the side door.</p>

<p>At stated hours, mostly in the evening, roughly-dressed
men called at the “Office,” stayed awhile,
and went away. Two dilapidated ladders made
their appearance in the yard, conspicuously lifting
their perished rungs above the gate level.</p>

<p>“I tried to buy an old builder’s cart and a
wheelbarrow to-day,” said “Mr. Jones” to a
workman. “I’ll probably get it to-morrow at my
own price, and it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get a
few sacks of lime and a couple of cartloads of
sand and bricks in, also a few road pitchers to
give it a finishing touch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>The workman grinned.</p>

<p>“You’ve got this place ready in time, Connor,”
he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Connor—for such “J. Jones, Builder and
Contractor” was—nodded and picked his teeth
meditatively with a match stick.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen for a long time the other place was
useless,” he said with a curse.</p>

<p>“It was bad luck that Angel found us there
last week. I’ve been fixing up this house for a
couple of months. It’s a nice neighborhood,
where people don’t go nosing around, and the boys
can meet here without anybody being the wiser.”</p>

<p>“And old George?”</p>

<p>“We’ll settle him to-night,” said the other
with a frown. “Bat is bringing him over, and
I want to know how he came to let Angel get
at us.”</p>

<p>Old George had always been a problem to the
“Borough Lot.” He held the position of trust
that many contended no demented old man should
hold. Was it safe or sane to trust him with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
plate that had been so laboriously acquired from
Roebury House, and the jewels of Lady Ivy
Task-Hender, for the purloining of which one
“Hog” Stander was at that very moment doing
seven stretch? Was it wise to install him as
custodian of the empty house at Blackwall,
through which Angel Esquire gained admittance
to the meeting-place of the “Borough Lot”?</p>

<p>Some there were who said “Yes,” and these
included the powerful faction that numbered
“Bat” Sands, “Curt” Goyle, and Connor
amongst them. They contended that suspicion
would never rest on this half-witted old gentleman,
with his stuffed birds, his goldfish, caged
rabbits and mice, a view that was supported by
the fact that Lady Ivy’s priceless diamonds lay
concealed for months in the false bottom of a
hutch devoted to guinea pigs in old George’s
strange menagerie, what time the police were
turning London inside out in their quest for the
property.</p>

<p>But now old George was under a cloud. Notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the fact that he had been found
amongst his live stock securely bound to a chair,
with a handkerchief over his mouth, suspicion attached
to him. How had Angel worked away
in the upper room without old George’s knowledge?</p>

<p>Angel might have easily explained. Indeed,
Angel might have relieved their minds to a very
large extent in regard to old George, for in marking
down the haunt of the “Borough Lot” he
had been entirely deceived as to the part played
by the old man who acted as “caretaker” to the
“empty” house.</p>

<p>In a fourwheeled cab old George, smiling foolishly
and passing his hand from time to time
over his tremulous mouth, listened to the admonitions
of Mr. Bat Sands.</p>

<p>“Connor wants to know all about it,” said Bat
menacingly; “and if you have been playing tricks,
old man, the Lord help you.”</p>

<p>“The Lord help me,” smiled old George complacently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>He ran his dirty fingers through his few scanty
white locks, and the smile died out of his face,
and his loose mouth dropped pathetically.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sands,” he said, then stopped; then he
repeated the name to himself a dozen times; then
he rubbed his head again.</p>

<p>Bat, leaning forward to catch what might be a
confession, sank back again in his seat and swore
softly.</p>

<p>In the house of “J. Jones, Builder and Contractor,”
were gathered in strength the men who
composed the “Borough Lot.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he gave us away,” asked Goyle,
“what shall we do with him?”</p>

<p>There was little doubt as to the feeling of the
meeting. A low animal growl, startling in its
ferocity, ran through the gathering.</p>

<p>“If he’s given us away”—it was Vinnis with
his dull fishlike eyes turned upon Connor who
was talking—“why, we must ‘out’ him.”</p>

<p>“You’re talking like a fool,” said Connor contemptuously.
“If he has given us away, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
may rest assured that he is no sooner in this house
than the whole place will be surrounded by police.
If Angel knows old George is one of us, he’ll be
watched day and night, and the cab that brings
him will be followed by another bringing Angel.
No, I’ll stake my life on the old man. But I
want to know how Mr. Cursed Angel got into the
house next door.”</p>

<p>They had not long to wait, for Bat’s knock
came almost as Connor finished speaking.</p>

<p>Half led, half dragged into the room, old
George stood, fumbling his hat in his hand, smiling
helplessly at the dark faces that met his. He
muttered something under his breath.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Connor sharply.</p>

<p>“I said, a gentleman——” began old George,
then lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>“What gentleman?” asked Connor roughly.</p>

<p>“I am speaking of myself,” said the old man,
and there came into his face a curious expression
of dignity. “I say, and I maintain, that a gentleman
is a gentleman whatever company he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
affects. At my old college I once reproved an
undergraduate.” He was speaking with stately,
almost pompous distinctness. “I said, ‘There is
an axiom to which I would refer you, <i>De gustibus
non est disputandum</i>, and—and——’”</p>

<p>His shaking fingers went up again to the tell-tale
mouth, and the vacant smile came back.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said Connor, shaking his arm,
“we don’t want to know anything about your
damned college; we want to know how Angel got
into our crib.”</p>

<p>The old man looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he muttered; “of course, Mr. Connor,
you have been most kind—the crib—ah!—the
young man who wanted to rent or hire the
room upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Connor eagerly.</p>

<p>“A most admirable young man,” old George
rambled on, “but very inquisitive. I remember
once, when I was addressing a large congregation
of young men at Cheltenham—or it may have
been young ladies—I——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Curse the man!” cried Goyle in a fury.
“Make him answer, or stop his mouth.”</p>

<p>Connor warned him back.</p>

<p>“Let him talk in his own way,” he said.</p>

<p>“This admirable person,” the old man went on,
happily striking on the subject again, “desired
information that I was not disposed to give, Mr.
Connor, remembering your many kindnesses, particularly
in respect to one Mr. Vinnis.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on,” urged Connor, and the face of
Vinnis was tense.</p>

<p>“I fear there are times when my usually active
mind takes on a sluggishness which is foreign
to my character—my normal character”—old
George was again the pedant—“when the unobservant
stranger might be deceived into regarding
me as a negligible quantity. The admirable
young man so far treated me as such as to remark
to his companion that there was a rope—yes,
distinctly a rope—for the said Mr.
Vinnis.”</p>

<p>The face of Vinnis was livid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“And,” asked Connor, “what happened next?
There were two of them, were there?”</p>

<p>The old man nodded gravely; he nodded a
number of times, as though the exercise pleased
him.</p>

<p>“The other young man—not the amiable one,
but another—upon finding that I could not rent
or hire the rooms—as indeed I could not, Mr.
Connor, without your permission—engaged me
in conversation—very loudly he spoke, too—on
the relative values of cabbage and carrot as food
for herbaceous mammals. Where the amiable
gentleman was at that moment I cannot say——”</p>

<p>“I can guess,” thought Connor.</p>

<p>“I can remember the occasion well,” old
George continued, “because that night I was
alarmed and startled by strange noises from the
empty rooms upstairs, which I very naturally and
properly concluded were caused——”</p>

<p>He stopped, and glancing fearfully about the
room, went on in a lower tone.</p>

<p>“By certain spirits,” he whispered mysteriously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and pointed and leered first at one and then
another of the occupants of the room.</p>

<p>There was something very eerie in the performance
of the strange old man with the queerly-working
face, and more than one hardened criminal
present shivered a little.</p>

<p>Connor broke the silence that fell on the
room.</p>

<p>“So that’s how it was done, eh? One held
you in conversation while the other got upstairs
and hid himself? Well, boys, you’ve heard the
old man. What d’ye say?”</p>

<p>Vinnis shifted in his seat and turned his great
unemotional face to where the old man stood, still
fumbling with his hat and muttering to himself
beneath his breath; in some strange region
whither his poor wandering mind had taken him
he was holding a conversation with an imaginary
person. Connor could see his eyebrows working,
and caught scraps of sentences, now in some
strange dead tongue, now in the stilted English
of the schoolmaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>It was Vinnis who spoke for the assembled
company.</p>

<p>“The old man knows a darned sight too much,”
he said in his level tone. “I’m for——”</p>

<p>He did not finish his sentence. Connor took a
swift survey of the men.</p>

<p>“If there is any man here,” he said slowly,
“who wants to wake up at seven o’clock in the
morning and meet a gentleman who will strap
his hands behind him and a person who will pray
over him—if there’s any man here that wants a
short walk after breakfast between two lines of
warders to a little shed where a brand new rope is
hanging from the roof, he’s at liberty to do what
he likes with old George, but not in this house.”</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on Vinnis.</p>

<p>“And if there’s any man here,” he went on,
“who’s already in the shadow of the rope, so that
one or two murders more won’t make much difference
one way or the other, he can do as he
likes—outside this house.”</p>

<p>Vinnis shrank back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“There’s nothing against me,” he growled.</p>

<p>“The rope,” muttered the old man, “Vinnis
for the rope,” he chuckled to himself. “I fear
they counted too implicitly upon the fact that I
am not always quite myself—Vinnis——”</p>

<p>The man he spoke of sprang to his feet with a
snarl like a trapped beast.</p>

<p>“Sit down—you.”</p>

<p>Bat Sands, with his red head close-cropped,
thrust his chair in the direction of the infuriated
Vinnis.</p>

<p>“What Connor says is true—we’re not going
to croak the old man, and we’re not going to
croak ourselves. If we hang, it will be something
worth hanging for. As to the old man, he’s
soft, an’ that’s all you can say. He’s got to be
kept close——”</p>

<p>A rap at the door cut him short.</p>

<p>“Who’s that?” he whispered.</p>

<p>Connor tiptoed to the locked door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he demanded.</p>

<p>A familiar voice reassured him, and he opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the door and held a conversation in a low voice
with somebody outside.</p>

<p>“There’s a man who wants to see me,” he said
in explanation. “Lock the door after I leave,
Bat,” and he went out quickly.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken, but each after his own
fashion of reasoning drew some conclusion from
Connor’s hasty departure.</p>

<p>“A full meetin’,” croaked a voice from the
back of the room. “We’re all asked here by
Connor. Is it a plant?”</p>

<p>That was Bat’s thought too.</p>

<p>“No,” he said; “there’s nothin’ against us.
Why, Angel let us off only last week because there
wasn’t evidence, an’ Connor’s straight.”</p>

<p>“I don’t trust him, by God!” said Vinnis.</p>

<p>“I trust nobody,” said Bat doggedly, “but
Connor’s straight——”</p>

<p>There was a rap on the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“All right!” said the muffled voice.</p>

<p>Bat unlocked the door, and Connor came in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
What he had seen or what he had heard had
brought about a marvelous change in his appearance—his
cheeks were a dull red, and his eyes
blazed with triumph.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he said, and they caught the infectious
thrill in his voice, “I’ve got the biggest thing for
you—a million pounds, share and share alike.”</p>

<p>He felt rather than heard the excitement his
words caused. He stood with his back to the
half-opened door.</p>

<p>“I’m going to introduce a new pal,” he rattled
on breathlessly. “I’ll vouch for him.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” asked Bat. “Do we know
him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Connor, “and you’re not expected
to know him. But he’s putting up the money,
and that’s good enough for you, Bat—a hundred
pounds a man, and it will be paid to-night.”</p>

<p>Bat Sands spat on his hand.</p>

<p>“Bring him in. He’s good enough,” and there
was a murmur of approval.</p>

<p>Connor disappeared for a moment, and returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
followed by a well-dressed stranger, who
met the questioning glances of his audience with
a quiet smile. His eyes swept over every face.
They rested for a moment on Vinnis, they looked
doubtfully at old George, who, seated on a chair
with crossed legs and his head bent, was talking
with great rapidity in an undertone to himself.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said the stranger, “I have come
with the object of gaining your help. Mr. Connor
has told me that he has already informed you
about Reale’s millions. Briefly, I have decided
to forestall other people, and secure the money
for myself. I offer you a half share of the
money, to be equally divided amongst you, and as
an earnest of my intention, I am paying each man
who is willing to help me a hundred pounds
down.”</p>

<p>He drew from one of his pockets a thick package
of notes, and from two other pockets similar
bundles. He handed them to Connor, and the
hungry eyes of the “Borough Lot” focused
upon the crinkling paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“What I shall ask you to do,” the stranger
proceeded, “I shall tell you later——”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” interrupted Bat. “Who else is
in this?”</p>

<p>“We alone,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“Is Jimmy in it?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Is Angel in it?”</p>

<p>“No” (impatiently).</p>

<p>“Go on,” said Bat, satisfied.</p>

<p>“The money is in a safe that can only be
opened by a word. That word nobody knows—so
far. The clue to the word was stolen a few
nights ago from the lawyer in charge of the case
by—Jimmy.”</p>

<p>He paused to note the effect of his words.</p>

<p>“Jimmy has passed the clue on to Scotland
Yard, and we cannot hope to get it.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Bat.</p>

<p>“What we can do,” the other went on, “is to
open the safe with something more powerful than
a word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“But the guard!” said Bat. “There’s an
armed guard kept there by the lawyer.”</p>

<p>“We can arrange about the guard,” said the
other.</p>

<p>“Why not get at the lawyer?” It was Curt
Goyle who made the suggestion.</p>

<p>The stranger frowned.</p>

<p>“The lawyer cannot be got at,” he said shortly.
“Now, are you with me?”</p>

<p>There was no need to ask. Connor was sorting
the notes into little bundles on the table, and
the men came up one by one, took their money,
and after a few words with Connor took
their leave, with an awkward salutation to the
stranger.</p>

<p>Bat was the last to go.</p>

<p>“To-morrow night—here,” muttered Connor.</p>

<p>He was left alone with the newcomer, save for
the old man, who hadn’t changed his attitude, and
was still in the midst of some imaginary conversation.</p>

<p>“Who is this?” the stranger demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Connor smiled.</p>

<p>“An old chap as mad as a March hare. A
gentleman, too, and a scholar; talks all sorts of
mad languages—Latin and Greek and the Lord
knows what. He’s been a schoolmaster, I should
say, and what brought him down to this—drink
or drugs or just ordinary madness—I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>The stranger looked with interest at the unconscious
man, and old George, as if suddenly realizing
that he was under scrutiny, woke up with a
start and sat blinking at the other. Then he
shuffled slowly to his feet and peered closely into
the stranger’s face, all the time sustaining his
mumbled conversation.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said in a voice rising from its inaudibility,
“a gentleman! Pleased to meet you,
sir, pleased to meet you. <i>Omnia mutantur, nos
et mutamur in illis</i>, but you have not changed.”</p>

<p>He relapsed again into mutterings.</p>

<p>“I have never met him before,” the stranger
said, turning to Connor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>“Oh, old George always thinks he has met
people,” said Connor with a grin.</p>

<p>“A gentleman,” old George muttered, “every
inch a gentleman, and a munificent patron. He
bought a copy of my book—you have read it?
It is called—dear me, I have forgotten what it is
called—and sent to consult me in his—ah!—anagram——”</p>

<p>“What?” The stranger’s face was ashen,
and he gripped Connor by the arm. “Listen,
listen!” he whispered fiercely.</p>

<p>Old George threw up his head again and stared
blandly at the stranger.</p>

<p>“A perfect gentleman,” he said with pathetic
insolence, “invariably addressing me as the ‘professor’—a
most delicate and gentlemanly thing
to do.”</p>

<p>He pointed a triumphant finger to the stranger.</p>

<p>“I know you!” he cried shrilly, and his
cracked laugh rang through the room. “Spedding,
that’s your name! Lawyer, too. I saw
you in the carriage of my patron.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“The book, the book!” gasped Spedding.
“What was the name of your book?”</p>

<p>Old George’s voice had dropped to its normal
level when he replied with extravagant courtesy—</p>

<p>“That is the one thing, sir, I can never remember.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE GREAT ATTEMPT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are supercilious critics who sneer at
Scotland Yard. They are quite unofficial critics,
of course, writers of stories wherein figure amateur
detectives of abnormal perspicuity, unraveling
mysteries with consummate ease which have
baffled the police for years. As a matter of fact,
Scotland Yard stands for the finest police organization
in the world. People who speak glibly
of “police blunders” might remember one curious
fact: in this last quarter of a century only one
man has ever stood in the dock at the Old Bailey
under the capital charge who has escaped the
dread sentence of the law.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard is patiently slow and terribly
sure.</p>

<p>Angel in his little room received a letter written
in a sprawling, uneducated hand; it was incoherent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and stained with tears and underlined from
end to end. He read it through and examined
the date stamp, then rang his bell.</p>

<p>The messenger who answered him found him
examining a map of London. “Go to the
Record Office, and get E.B. 93,” he said, and in
five minutes the messenger came back with a thick
folder bulging with papers.</p>

<p>There were newspaper cuttings and plans and
dreadful photographs, the like of which the outside
world do not see, and there was a little key
ticketed with an inscription. Angel looked
through the <i>dossier</i> carefully, then read the
woman’s letter again....</p>

<p>Vinnis, the man with the dead-white face, finishing
his late breakfast, and with the pleasurable
rustle of new banknotes in his trouser pocket,
strolled forth into Commercial Road, E. An
acquaintance leaning against a public-house gave
him a curt nod of recognition; a bedraggled girl
hurrying homeward with her man’s breakfast in
her apron shrank on one side, knowing Vinnis to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
her sorrow; a stray cur cringed up to him, as he
stood for a moment at the edge of the road, and
was kicked for its pains.</p>

<p>Vinnis was entirely without sentiment, and
besides, even though the money in his pocket
compensated for most things, the memory
of old George and his babbling talk worried
him.</p>

<p>Somebody on the other side of the road attracted
his attention. It was a woman, and he
knew her very well, therefore he ignored her
beckoning hand. Two days ago he had occasion
to reprove her, and he had seized the opportunity
to summarily dissolve the informal union that
had kept them together for five years. So he
made no sign when the woman with the bruised
face called him, but turned abruptly and walked
towards Aldgate.</p>

<p>He did not look round, but by and by he heard
the patter of her feet behind, and once his name
called hoarsely. He struck off into a side street
with a raging devil inside him, then when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
reached an unfrequented part of the road he
turned on her.</p>

<p>She saw the demon in his eyes, and tried to
speak. She was a penitent woman at that moment,
and hysterically ripe for confession, but the
savage menace of the man froze her lips.</p>

<p>“So,” he said, his thin mouth askew, “so after
what I’ve said an’ what I’ve done you follow me,
do you. Showing me up in the street, eh!”</p>

<p>He edged closer to her, his fist doubled, and
she, poor drab, fascinated by the snakelike glare
of his dull eyes, stood rooted to the spot. Then
with a snarl he struck her—once, twice—and she
fell a huddled, moaning heap on the pavement.</p>

<p>You may do things in Commercial Road, E.,
after “lighting-up time” that are not permissible
in the broad light of the day, unless it be Saturday,
and the few people who had been attracted
by the promise of a row were indignant but passive,
after the manner of all London crowds. Not
so one quiet, middle-aged man, who confronted
Vinnis as he began to walk away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“That was a particularly brutal thing to do,”
said the quiet man.</p>

<p>Vinnis measured him with his eye, and decided
that this was not a man to be trifled with.</p>

<p>“I’ve got nothing to say to you,” he said
roughly, and tried to push past, but an iron grip
was on his arm.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, my friend,” said the other
steadily, “not so fast; you cannot commit a
brutal assault in the open street like that without
punishment. I must ask you to walk with me to
the station.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I won’t go?” demanded Vinnis.</p>

<p>“I shall take you,” said the other. “I am
Detective-Sergeant Jarvis from Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>Vinnis thought rapidly. There wasn’t much
chance of escape; the street they were in was a
cul-de-sac, and at the open end two policemen had
made their appearance. After all, a “wife” assault
was not a serious business, and the woman—well,
she would swear it was an accident. He
resolved to go quietly; at the worst it would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
month, so with a shrug of his shoulders he accompanied
the detective. A small crowd followed
them to the station.</p>

<p>In the little steel dock he stood in his stockinged
feet whilst a deft jailer ran his hands over him.
With a stifled oath, he remembered the money in
his possession; it was only ten pounds, for he had
secreted the other, but ten pounds is a lot of
money to be found on a person of his class, and
generally leads to embarrassing inquiries. To
his astonishment, the jailer who relieved him of
the notes seemed in no whit surprised, and the inspector
at the desk took the discovery as a matter
of course. Vinnis remarked on the surprising
number of constables there were on duty in the
charge room. Then—</p>

<p>“What is the charge?” asked the inspector,
dipping his pen.</p>

<p>“Wilful murder!” said a voice, and Angel
Esquire crossed the room from the inspector’s
office. “I charge this man with having on the
night of the 17th of February....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Vinnis, dumb with terror and rage, listened to
the crisp tones of the detective as he detailed the
particulars of an almost forgotten crime. It was
the story of a country house burglary, a man-servant
who surprised the thief, a fight in the
dark, a shot and a dead man lying in the big
drawing-room. It was an ordinary little tragedy,
forgotten by everybody save Scotland Yard; but
year by year unknown men had pieced together
the scraps of evidence that had come to them;
strand by strand had the rope been woven that
was to hang a cold-blooded murderer; last of all
came the incoherent letter from a jealous woman—Scotland
Yard waits always for a jealous
woman—and the evidence was complete.</p>

<p>“Put him in No. 14,” said the inspector. Then
Vinnis woke up, and the six men on duty in the
charge room found their time fully occupied.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Vinnis was arrested, as Angel Esquire put it,
“in the ordinary way of business.” Hundreds of
little things happen daily at Scotland Yard in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
ordinary way of business which, apparently unconnected
one with the other, have an extraordinary
knack of being in some remote fashion
related. A burglary at Clapham was remarkable
for the fact that a cumbersome mechanical toy
was carried away in addition to other booty. A
street accident in the Kingsland Road led to the
arrest of a drunken carman. In the excitement
of the moment a sneak-thief purloined a parcel
from the van, was chased and captured. A weeping
wife at the police station gave him a good
character as husband and father. “Only last
week he brought my boy a fine performin’
donkey.” An alert detective went home with her,
recognized the mechanical toy from the description,
and laid by the heels the notorious “Kingsland
Road Lot.”</p>

<p>The arrest of Vinnis was totally unconnected
with Angel’s investigations into the mystery of
Reale’s millions. He knew him as a “Borough
man,” but did not associate him with the search
for the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>None the less, there are certain formalities attached
to the arrest of all bad criminals. Angel
Esquire placed one or two minor matters in the
hands of subordinates, and in two days one of
these waited upon him in his office.</p>

<p>“The notes, sir,” said the man, “were issued
to Mr. Spedding on his private account last Monday
morning. Mr. Spedding is a lawyer, of the
firm of Spedding, Mortimer and Larach.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Mr. Spedding?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Mr. Spedding remembers drawing
the money and paying it away to a gentleman who
was sailing to America.”</p>

<p>“A client?”</p>

<p>“So far as I can gather,” said the subordinate,
“the money was paid on behalf of a client for
services. Mr. Spedding would not particularize.”</p>

<p>Angel Esquire made a little grimace.</p>

<p>“Lawyers certainly do queer things,” he said
dryly.</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Spedding offer any suggestion as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
to how the money came into this man’s possession?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He thinks he might have obtained
it quite honestly. I understand that the man
who received the money was a shady sort of
customer.”</p>

<p>“So I should imagine,” said Angel Esquire.</p>

<p>Left alone, he sat in deep thought drawing
faces on his blotting-pad.</p>

<p>Then he touched a bell.</p>

<p>“Send Mr. Carter to me,” he directed, and in
a few minutes a bright-faced youth, fingering an
elementary mustache, was awaiting his orders.</p>

<p>“Carter,” said Angel cautiously, “it must be
very dull work in the finger-print department.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir,” said the other, a fairly
enthusiastic ethnologist, “we’ve got——”</p>

<p>“Carter,” said Angel more cautiously still,
“are you on for a lark?”</p>

<p>“Like a bird, sir,” said Carter, unconsciously
humorous.</p>

<p>“I want a dozen men, the sort of men who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
won’t talk to reporters, and will remain ‘unofficial’
so long as I want them to be,” said Angel,
and he unfolded his plan.</p>

<p>When the younger man had gone Angel drew a
triangle on the blotting-pad.</p>

<p>“Spedding is in with the ‘Borough Lot,’” he
put a cross against one angle. “Spedding knows
I know,” he put a cross at the apex. “I know
that Spedding knows I know,” he marked the
remaining angle. “It’s Spedding’s move, and
he’ll move damn quick.”</p>

<p>The Assistant-Commissioner came into the
room at that moment.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Angel!” he said, glancing at the figures
on the pad. “What’s this, a new game?”</p>

<p>“It’s an old game,” said Angel truthfully, “but
played in an entirely new way.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Angel was not far wrong when he surmised
that Spedding’s move would be immediate, and
although the detective had reckoned without an
unknown factor, in the person of old George, yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
a variety of circumstances combined to precipitate
the act that Angel anticipated.</p>

<p>Not least of these was the arrest of Vinnis.
After his interview with old George, Spedding
had decided on a waiting policy. The old man
had been taken to the house at Clapham. Spedding
had been prepared to wait patiently until
some freak of mind brought back the memory to
the form of cryptogram he had advised. A dozen
times a day he asked the old man—</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Old George, only old George,” was the invariable
reply, with many grins and noddings.</p>

<p>“But your real name, the name you had when
you were a—professor.”</p>

<p>But this would only start the old man off on a
rambling reminiscence of his “munificent patron.”</p>

<p>Connor came secretly to Clapham for orders.
It was the night after Vinnis had been arrested.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to move at once, Mr. Connor,”
said the lawyer. Connor sat in the chair that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
had held Jimmy a few nights previous. “It is
no use waiting for the old man to talk, the earlier
plan was best.”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened?” asked Connor.
His one-time awe of the lawyer had merged in the
familiarity of conspiratorship.</p>

<p>“There was a detective at my office to-day
inquiring about some notes that were found
on Vinnis. Angel Esquire will draw his
own conclusions, and we have no time to
lose.”</p>

<p>“We are ready,” said Connor.</p>

<p>“Then let it be to-morrow night. I will withdraw
the guard of commissionaires at the safe. I
can easily justify myself afterwards.”</p>

<p>An idea struck Connor.</p>

<p>“Why not send another lot of men to relieve
them? I can fix up some of the boys so that
they’ll look like commissionaires.”</p>

<p>Spedding’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said slowly, “it could be arranged—an
excellent idea.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>He paced the room with long, swinging strides,
his forehead puckered.</p>

<p>“There are two reliefs,” he said, “one in the
morning and one in the evening. I could send a
note to the sergeant of the morning relief telling
him that I had arranged for a new set of night
men—I have changed them twice already, one
cannot be too careful—and I could give you the
necessary authority to take over charge.”</p>

<p>“Better still,” said Connor, “instruct him to
withdraw, leaving the place empty, then our arrival
will attract no notice. Lombard Street
must be used to the commissionaires going on
guard.”</p>

<p>“That is an idea,” said Spedding, and sat down
to write the letter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The night of the great project turned out miserably
wet.</p>

<p>“So much the better,” muttered Connor, viewing
the world from his Kensington fastness. The
room dedicated to the use of the master of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
house was plainly furnished, and on the bare deal
table Connor had set his whisky down whilst he
peered through the rain-blurred windows at the
streaming streets.</p>

<p>“England for work and Egypt for pleasure,”
he muttered; “and if I get my share of the
money, and it will be a bigger share than my
friend Spedding imagines, it’s little this cursed
country will see of Mr. Patrick Connor.”</p>

<p>He drained off his whisky at a gulp, rubbed
the steam from the windows, and looked down
into the deserted street. Two men were walking
toward the house. One, well covered by a heavy
mackintosh cloak, moved with a long stride; the
other, wrapped in a new overcoat, shuffled by his
side, quickening his steps to keep up with his
more energetic companion.</p>

<p>“Spedding,” said Connor, “and old George.
What is he bringing him here for?”</p>

<p>He hurried downstairs to let them in.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Spedding, throwing his reeking
coat off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“All’s ready,” answered Connor. “Why
have you brought the old man?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for company,” the lawyer answered carelessly.</p>

<p>If the truth be told, Spedding still hoped that
the old man would remember. That day old
George had been exceedingly garrulous, almost
lucidly so at times. Mr. Spedding still held on
to the faint hope that the old man’s revelations
would obviate the necessity for employing the
“Borough Lot,” and what was more important,
for sharing the contents of the safe with
them.</p>

<p>As to this latter part of the program, Mr.
Spedding had plans which would have astonished
Connor had he but known.</p>

<p>But old George’s loquacity stopped short at the
all-important point of instructing the lawyer on
the question of the cryptogram. He had brought
him along in the hope that at the eleventh hour
the old man would reveal his identity.</p>

<p>Unconscious of the responsibility that lay upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
his foolish head, the old man sat in the upstairs
room communing with himself.</p>

<p>“We will leave him here,” said the lawyer, “he
will be safe.”</p>

<p>“Safe enough. I know him of old. He’ll sit
here for hours amusing himself.”</p>

<p>“And now, what about the men?” asked the
lawyer. “Where do we meet them?”</p>

<p>“We shall pick them up at the corner of Lombard
Street, and they’ll follow me to the Safe
Deposit.”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>They turned swiftly on old George, who with
his chin raised and with face alert was staring
at them.</p>

<p>“Safe Deposit, Lombard Street,” he mumbled.
“And a most excellent plan too—a most excellent
plan.”</p>

<p>The two men held their breath.</p>

<p>“And quite an ingenious idea, sir. Did you
say Lombard Street—a safe?” he muttered. “A
safe with a word? And how to conceal the word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
that’s the question. I am a man of honor, you
may trust me.” He made a sweeping bow to
some invisible presence. “Why not conceal your
word thus?”</p>

<p>Old George stabbed the palm of his hand with
a grimy forefinger.</p>

<p>“Why not? Have you read my book? It is
only a little book, but useful, sir, remarkably useful.
The drawings and the signs are most accurate.
An eminent gentleman at the British
Museum assisted me in its preparation. It is
called—it is called——” He passed his hand
wearily over his head, and slid down into his
chair again, a miserable old man muttering
foolishly.</p>

<p>Spedding wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p>“Nearly, nearly!” he said huskily. “By
Heavens! he nearly told us.”</p>

<p>Connor looked at him with suspicion.</p>

<p>“What’s all this about the book?” he demanded.
“This is the second time old George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
has spoken like this. It’s to do with old Reale,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Spedding nodded.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Connor, looking at his watch,
“it’s time we were moving. We’ll leave the old
man to look after the house. Here, George.”</p>

<p>Old George looked up.</p>

<p>“You’ll stay here, and not leave till we return.
D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“I hear, Mr. Connor, sir,” said old George,
with his curious assumption of dignity, “and
hearing, obey.”</p>

<p>As the two men turned into the night the rain
pelted down and a gusty northwesterly wind blew
into their faces.</p>

<p>“George,” said Connor, answering a question,
“oh, we’ve had him for years. One of the boys
found him wandering about Limehouse with
hardly any clothes to his back, and brought him
to us. That was before I knew the ‘Borough
Lot,’ but they used him as a blind. He was
worth the money it cost to keep him in food.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Spedding kept the other waiting whilst he dispatched
a long telegram from the Westbourne
Grove Post Office. It was addressed to the
master of the <i>Polecat</i> lying at Cardiff, and was
reasonably unintelligible to the clerk.</p>

<p>They found a hansom at the corner of Queen’s
Road, and drove to the Bank; here they alighted
and crossed to the Royal Exchange. Some men
in uniform overcoats who were standing about
exchanged glances with Connor, and as the two
leaders doubled back to Lombard Street, followed
them at a distance.</p>

<p>“The guard left at four o’clock,” said Spedding,
fitting the key of the heavy outer door. He
waited a few minutes in the inky black darkness
of the vestibule whilst Connor admitted the six
uniformed men who had followed them.</p>

<p>“Are we all here?” said Connor in a low
voice. “Bat? Here! Goyle? Here! Lamby?
Here!”</p>

<p>One by one he called them by their names and
they answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>“We may as well have a light,” said Spedding,
and felt for the switch.</p>

<p>The gleam of the electric lamps showed Spedding
as pure a collection of scoundrels as ever
disgraced the uniform of a gallant corps.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Spedding in level tones, “are all
the necessary tools here?”</p>

<p>Bat’s grin was the answer.</p>

<p>“If we can get an electric connection,” he said,
“we’ll burn out the lock of the safe in half——”</p>

<p>Spedding had walked to the inner door that
led to the great hall, and was fumbling with the
keys. Suddenly he started back.</p>

<p>“Hark!” he whispered. “I heard a step in
the hall.”</p>

<p>Connor listened.</p>

<p>“I hear nothing,” he began, when the inner
door was thrown open, and a commissionaire, revolver
in hand, stepped out.</p>

<p>“Stand!” he cried. Then, recognizing Spedding,
dropped the muzzle of his pistol.</p>

<p>White with rage, Spedding stood amidst his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
ill-assorted bodyguard. In the searching white
light of the electric lamps there was no mistaking
their character. He saw the commissionaire eying
them curiously.</p>

<p>“I understood,” he said slowly, “that the
guard had been relieved.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the man, and the cluster of
uniformed men at the door of the inner hall confirmed
this.</p>

<p>“I sent orders this afternoon,” said Spedding
between his teeth.</p>

<p>“No orders have been received, sir,” and the
lawyer saw the scrutinizing eye of the soldierly
sentry pass over his confederates.</p>

<p>“Is this the relief?” asked the guard, not attempting
to conceal the contempt in his tone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the lawyer.</p>

<p>As the sentry saluted and disappeared into the
hall Spedding drew Connor aside.</p>

<p>“This is ruin,” he said quickly. “The safe
must be cleared to-night. To-morrow London
will not hold me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>The sentry reappeared at the doorway and
beckoned them in. They shuffled into the great
hall, where in the half darkness the safe loomed
up from its rocky pedestal, an eerie, mysterious
thing. He saw Bat Sands glancing uncomfortably
around the dim spaces of the building, and
felt the impression of the loneliness.</p>

<p>A man who wore the stripes of a sergeant came
up.</p>

<p>“Are we to withdraw, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Spedding shortly.</p>

<p>“Will you give us a written order?” asked
the man.</p>

<p>Spedding hesitated, then drew out a pocketbook
and wrote a few hasty words on a sheet,
tore it out, and handed it to the man.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked at it carefully.</p>

<p>“You haven’t signed it or dated it either,” he
said respectfully, and handed it back.</p>

<p>Spedding cursed him under his breath and rectified
the omissions.</p>

<p>“Now you may go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>In the half-light, for only one solitary electrolier
illuminated the vast hall, he thought the man
was smiling. It might have been a trick of the
shadows, for he could not see his face.</p>

<p>“And am I to leave you alone?” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is it safe?” the non-commissioned officer
asked quietly.</p>

<p>“Curse you, what do you mean?” cried the
lawyer.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other easily, “I see you have
Connor with you, a notorious thief and blackmailer.”</p>

<p>The lawyer was dumb.</p>

<p>“And Bat Sands. How d’ye do, Bat? How
did they treat you in Borstal, or was it Parkhurst?”
drawled the sergeant. “And there’s
the gentle Lamby trying hard to look military in
an overcoat too large for him. That’s not
the uniform you’re used to wearing, Lamby,
eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>From the group of men at the door came a
genuinely amused laugh.</p>

<p>“Guard the outer door, one of you chaps,”
said the sergeant, and turning again to Spedding’s
men, “Here we have our respected friend Curt
Goyle.”</p>

<p>He stooped and picked up a bag that Bat had
placed gingerly on the floor.</p>

<p>“What a bag of tricks,” the sergeant cooed,
“diamond bits and dynamite cartridges and—what’s
this little thing, Bat—an ark? It is. By
Jove, I congratulate you on the swag.”</p>

<p>Spedding had recovered his nerve and strode
forward. He was playing for the greatest stake
in the world.</p>

<p>“You shall be punished for this insolence,” he
stormed.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the imperturbable sergeant.</p>

<p>Somebody at the door spoke.</p>

<p>“Here’s another one, sergeant,” and pushed a
queer old figure into the hall, a figure that blinked
and peered from face to face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>He espied Spedding, and ran up to him almost
fawning.</p>

<p>“The Safe Deposit—in Lombard Street,” he
cackled joyously. “You see, I remembered, dear
friend; and I’ve come to tell you about the book—my
book, you know. My munificent patron
who desired a puzzle word——”</p>

<p>The sergeant started forward.</p>

<p>“My God!” he cried, “the professor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” chuckled the old man, “that’s
what he called me. He bought a copy of my
book—two sovereigns, four sovereigns he gave
me. The book—what was it called?”</p>

<p>The old man paused and clasped both hands to
his head.</p>

<p>“<i>A Study—a Study</i>” he said painfully, “<i>on
the Origin of—the Alphabet.</i> Ah!”</p>

<p>Another of the commissionaires had come forward
as the old man began speaking, and to him
the sergeant turned.</p>

<p>“Make a note of that, Jimmy,” the sergeant
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>Spedding reeled back as though he had been
struck.</p>

<p>“Angel!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“That’s me,” was the ungrammatical reply.</p>

<p>Crushed, cowed, beaten and powerless, Spedding
awaited judgment. What form it would
take he could not guess, that it would effectively
ruin him he did not doubt. The trusted lawyer
stood self-condemned; there was no explaining
away his companions, there could be no mistaking
the meaning of their presence.</p>

<p>“Send your men away,” said Angel.</p>

<p>A wild hope seized the lawyer. The men were
not to be arrested, there was a chance for him.</p>

<p>The “Borough Lot” needed no second ordering;
they trooped through the doorway, anxious
to reach the open air before Angel changed his
mind.</p>

<p>“You may go,” said Angel to Connor, who
still lingered.</p>

<p>“If the safe is to be opened, I’m in it,” was
the sullen reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“You may go,” said Angel; “the safe will not
be opened to-night.”</p>

<p>“I——”</p>

<p>“Go!” thundered the detective, and Connor
slunk away.</p>

<p>Angel beckoned the commissionaire who had
first interrogated Spedding.</p>

<p>“Take charge of that bag, Carter. There are
all sorts of things in it that go off.” Then he
turned to the lawyer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spedding, there is a great deal that I
have to say to you, but it would be better to defer
our conversation; the genuine guard will return
in a few minutes. I told them to return at 10
o’clock.”</p>

<p>“By what authority?” blustered Spedding.</p>

<p>“Tush!” said Angel wearily. “Surely we
have got altogether beyond that stage. Your
order for withdrawal was expected by me. I
waited upon the sergeant of the guard with another
order.”</p>

<p>“A forged order, I gather?” said Spedding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
recovering his balance. “Now I see why you
have allowed my men to go. I overrated your
generosity.”</p>

<p>“The order,” said Angel soberly, “was signed
by His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Home
Affairs”—he tapped the astonished lawyer on
the shoulder—“and if it would interest you to
know, I have a warrant in my pocket for the
arrest of every man jack of you. That I do not
put it into execution is a matter of policy.”</p>

<p>The lawyer scanned the calm face of the detective
in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me?” he asked at
length.</p>

<p>“Your presence at Jimmy’s flat at ten o’clock
to-morrow morning,” replied Angel.</p>

<p>“I will be there,” said the other, and turned
to go.</p>

<p>“And, Mr. Spedding,” called Jimmy, as the
lawyer reached the door, “in regard to a boat
you have chartered from Cardiff, I think you
need not go any further in the matter. One of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
my men is at present interviewing the captain,
and pointing out to him the enormity of the
offense of carrying fugitives from justice to
Spanish-American ports.”</p>

<p>“Damn you!” said Spedding, and slammed
the door.</p>

<p>Jimmy removed the commissionaire’s cap from
his head and grinned.</p>

<p>“One of these fine days, Angel, you’ll lose
your job, introducing the Home Secretary’s name.
Phew!”</p>

<p>“It had to be done,” said Angel sadly. “It
hurts me to lie, but I couldn’t very well tell Spedding
that the sergeant of the commissionaires had
been one of my own men all along, could I?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>SOME BAD CHARACTERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened that on the night of the great attempt
the inquisitive Mr. Lane, of 76 Cawdor
Street, was considerably exercised in his mind as
to the depleted condition of his humble treasury.
With Mr. Lane the difference between affluence
and poverty was a matter of shillings. His line
of business was a humble one. Lead piping and
lengths of telephone wire, an occasional door-mat
improvidently left outside whilst the servant
cleaned the hall, these represented the scope and
extent of his prey. Perhaps he reached his zenith
when he lifted an overcoat from a hatstand what
time a benevolent old lady was cutting him thick
slices of bread and butter in a basement kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane had only recently returned from a
short stay in Wormwood Scrubbs Prison. It
was over a trifling affair of horsehair abstracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
from railway carriage cushions that compelled
Mr. Lane’s retirement for two months. It was
that same affair that brought about his undoing
on the night of the attempt.</p>

<p>For the kudos of the railway theft had nerved
him to more ambitious attempts, and with a depleted
exchequer to urge him forward, and the
prestige of his recent achievements to support
him, he decided upon burglary. It was a wild
and reckless departure from his regular line, and
he did not stop to consider the disabilities attaching
to a change of profession, nor debate the unpropitious
conditions of an already overstocked
labor market. It is reasonable to suppose that
Mr. Lane lacked the necessary qualities of logic
and balance to argue any point to its obvious conclusion,
for he was, intellectually, the reverse of
brilliant, and was therefore ill-equipped for introspective
or psychological examination of the circumstances
leading to his decision. Communing
with himself, the inquisitive Mr. Lane put the
matter tersely and brutally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>“Lead pipin’s no go unless you’ve got a pal to
work with; telephone wires is so covered up with
wood casin’ that it’s worse’n hard work to pinch
two-penn’oth. I’m goin’ to have a cut at Joneses.”</p>

<p>So in the pelting rain he watched “Joneses”
from a convenient doorway. He noted with satisfaction
the “workmen” departing one by one;
he observed with joy the going of “Jones” himself;
and when, some few minutes afterwards, the
queer-looking old man, whom he suspected as being
a sort of caretaker, came shuffling out, slamming
the gate behind him, and peering left and
right, and mumbling to himself as he squelched
through the rain, the watcher regarded the removal
of this final difficulty as being an especial
act of Providence.</p>

<p>He waited for another half-hour, because, for
some reason or other, the usually deserted street
became annoyingly crowded. First came a belated
coal cart and a miserably bedraggled carman
who cried his wares dolefully. Then a small
boy, escaping from the confines of his domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
circle, came to revel in the downpour and wade
ecstatically but thoroughly through the puddles
that had formed on the uneven surface of the
road. Nemesis, in the shape of a shrill-voiced
mother, overtook the boy and sent him whining
and expectant to the heavy hand of maternal
authority. With the coast clear Mr. Lane lost
no time. In effecting an entrance to the headquarters
of the “Borough Lot,” Mr. Lane’s
method lacked subtlety. He climbed over the
gate leading to the yard, trusting inwardly that
he was not observed, but taking his chance. Had
he been an accomplished burglar, with the experience
of any exploits behind him, he would
have begun by making a very thorough inspection
of likely windows. Certainly he would never
have tried the “office” door. Being the veriest
tyro, and being conscious, moreover, that his
greatest feats had connection with doors carelessly
left ajar, he tried the door, and to his delight
it opened.</p>

<p>Again the skilled craftsman would have suspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
some sort of treachery, and might have
withdrawn; but Mr. Lane, recognizing in the fact
that the old man had forgotten to fasten the door
behind him only yet another proof of that benevolent
Providence which exerts itself for the express
service of men “in luck,” entered boldly.
He lit a candle stump and looked around.</p>

<p>The evidence of that wealth which is the particular
possession of “master-men” was not
evident. Indeed, the floor of the passage was
uncarpeted, and the walls bare of picture or ornament.
Nor was the “office,” a little room leading
from the “passage,” any more prolific of
result. Such fixtures as there were had apparently
been left behind by the previous tenant, and
these were thick with dust.</p>

<p>“Bah!” said the inquisitive Mr. Lane scornfully,
and his words echoed hollowly as in an
empty house.</p>

<p>With the barren possibilities of his exploit before
him, Mr. Lane’s spirits fell.</p>

<p>He was of the class, to whom reference has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
already been made, that looked in awe and reverence
toward the “Borough Lot” in the same
spirit as the youthful curate might regard the
consistory of bishops. In his cups—pewter cups
they were with frothing heads a-top—he was
wont to boast that his connection with the “Borough
Lot” was both close and intimate. A
rumor that went around to the effect that the
“mouthpiece” who defended him at the closing
of the unsatisfactory horsehair episode had been
paid for by the “Borough Lot” he did not
trouble to contradict.</p>

<p>If he had known any of them, even by sight,
he would not at that moment have been effecting
a burglarious entry into their premises.</p>

<p>Room after room he searched. He found the
ill-furnished bedroom of Connor, and the room
where old George slept on an uncleanly mattress.
He found, too, the big room where the “Lot”
held their informal meetings, but nothing portable.
Nothing that a man might slip under his
coat, and walk boldly out of the front door with.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
No little article of jewelry that your wife might
carry to a pawnbroker’s with a long face and a
longer story of a penury that forced you to part
with her dear mother’s last gift. None of these,
noted Mr. Lane bitterly, and with every fresh
disappointment he breathed the harder.</p>

<p>For apart from the commercial aspect of this,
his burglary, there was the sickening humiliation
of failure. An imaginative man, he had already
invented the story he was to tell to a few select
cronies in sneak-thief division. He had rehearsed
mentally a scene where, with an air of nonchalance,
he drew a handful of golden sovereigns
from his pocket and ordered drinks round. And
whilst they were sipping his drinks, smirking respectfully,
he would have confided to them the
fact that he had been duly, and with all ceremony,
installed a full-fledged member of the “Borough
Lot.” Of the irony of the situation he was ignorant.
A qualified burglar would have completed
a systematic examination of the premises in ten
minutes, but Mr. Lane was not so qualified. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
consequence he dawdled from room to room, going
back to this room to make sure, and returning
to that room to be absolutely certain that nothing
had been overlooked. Oblivious of the flight of
time, he stood irresolutely in the topmost room
of the house when the real adventure of the evening
began. He heard the click of a lock—he
had thoughtfully closed the office door behind
him—and a voice, and his heart leapt into his
throat. He heard a voice, a voice hoarse with
rage, and another, and yet another.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane realized, from the stamping of feet
on the stairs, that half a dozen men had come into
the house; from their language he gathered they
were annoyed.</p>

<p>Then he heard something that froze his blood
and turned his marrow to water.</p>

<p>It had begun in a rumble of hoarse, undistinguishable
words, and ended in the phrase that
caught his ear.</p>

<p>“... he’s sold us, I tell ye! Put spies on
us! He led us into the trap, curse him....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>He heard another voice speaking in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>“What are we worth? You’re a fool! What
d’ye think we’re worth? Ain’t we the ‘Borough
Lot’? Don’t he know enough to hang two or
three of us.... It’s Connor and his pal the
lawyer....”</p>

<p>The “Borough Lot”!</p>

<p>The paralyzing intelligence came to Mr. Lane,
and he held on to the bare mantelshelf for support.
Spies! Suppose they discovered him,
and mistook him for a spy! His hair rose at the
thought. He knew them well enough by repute.
Overmuch hero-worship had invested them with
qualities for evil which they may or may not have
possessed.</p>

<p>There might be a chance of escape. The
tumult below continued. Scraps of angry talk
came floating up.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane looked out of the window; the drop
into the street was too long, and there was no
sign of rope in the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>Cautiously he opened the door of the room.
The men were in the room beneath that in which
he stood. The staircase that led to the street
must take him past their door.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane was very anxious to leave the house.
He had unwittingly stepped into a hornets’ nest,
and wanted to make his escape without disturbing
the inmates. Now was the time—or never.
Whilst the angry argument continued a creaking
stair board or so might not attract attention. But
he made no allowance for the gifts of these men—gifts
of sight and hearing. Bat Sands, in the
midst of his tirade, saw the uplifted finger and
head-jerk of Goyle. He did not check his flow
of invective, but edged toward the door; then he
stopped short, and flinging the door open, he
caught the scared Mr. Lane by the throat, and
dragging him into the room, threw him upon the
ground and knelt on him.</p>

<p>“What are ye doing here?” he whispered
fiercely.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane, with protruding eyes, saw the pitiless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
faces about him, saw Goyle lift a life-preserver
from the table and turn half-round the better to
strike, and fainted.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” growled Bat, with outstretched
hand. “The little swine has fainted. Who is
he? Do any of you fellers know him?”</p>

<p>It was the wizened-faced man whom Angel had
addressed as Lamby who furnished the identification.</p>

<p>“He’s a little crook—name of Lane.”</p>

<p>“Where does he come from?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hereabouts. He was in the Scrubbs in
my time,” said Lamby.</p>

<p>They regarded the unconscious burglar in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Go through his pockets,” suggested Goyle.</p>

<p>It happened—and this was the most providential
happening of the day from Mr. Lane’s point
of view—that when he had decided upon embarking
on his career of high-class crime he had
thoughtfully provided himself with a few homemade
instruments. It was the little poker with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
flattened end to form a jemmy and the center-bit
that was found in his pocket that in all probability
saved Mr. Lane’s life.</p>

<p>Lombroso and other great criminologists have
given it out that your true degenerate has no
sense of humor, but on two faces at least there
was a broad grin when the object of the little
man’s visit was revealed.</p>

<p>“He came to burgle Connor,” said Bat admiringly.
“Here, pass over the whisky, one
of ye!”</p>

<p>He forced a little down the man’s throat, and
Mr. Lane blinked and opened his eyes in a frightened
stare.</p>

<p>“Stand up,” commanded Bat, “an’ give an
account of yourself, young feller. What d’ye
mean by breaking into——”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” Goyle interrupted
savagely. “What has he heard when he was
sneaking outside?—that’s the question.”</p>

<p>“Nothin’, gentlemen!” gasped the unfortunate
Mr. Lane, “on me word, gentlemen!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
I’ve been in trouble like yourselves,
an’——”</p>

<p>He realized he had blundered.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Goyle with ominous calm, “so
you’ve been in trouble like us, have you?”</p>

<p>“I mean——”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” hissed the other;
“you mean you’ve been listenin’ to what we’ve
been saying, you little skunk, and you’re ready to
bleat to the first copper.”</p>

<p>It might have gone hard with Mr. Lane but
for the opportune arrival of the messenger. Bat
went downstairs at the knock, and the rest stood
quietly listening. They expected Connor, and
when his voice did not sound on the stairs they
looked at one another questioningly. Bat came
into the room with a yellow envelope in his hand.
He passed it to Goyle. Reading was not an accomplishment
of his. Goyle read it with difficulty.</p>

<p>“Do the best you can,” he read. “I’m lying
‘doggo.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>“What does that mean?” snarled Goyle, holding
the message in his hand and looking at Bat.
“Hidin’, is he—and we’ve got to do the best we
can?”</p>

<p>Bat reached for his overcoat. He did not speak
as he struggled into it, nor until he had buttoned
it deliberately.</p>

<p>“It means—git,” he said shortly. “It means
run, or else it means time, an’ worse than
time.”</p>

<p>He swung round to the door.</p>

<p>“Connor’s hidin’,” he stopped to say. “When
Connor starts hiding the place is getting hot.
There’s nothing against me so far as I know,
except——”</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the form of Mr. Lane. He
had raised himself to a sitting position on
the floor, and now, with disheveled hair
and outstretched legs, he sat the picture of
despair.</p>

<p>Goyle intercepted the glance.</p>

<p>“What about him?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Leave him,” said Bat; “we’ve got no time
for fooling with him.”</p>

<p>A motor-car came buzzing down Cawdor
Street, which was unusual. They heard the grind
of its brakes outside the door, and that in itself
was sufficiently alarming. Bat extinguished the
light, and cautiously opened the shutters. He
drew back with an oath.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Goyle whispered.</p>

<p>Bat made no reply, and they heard him open
his matchbox.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” whispered Goyle
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Light the lamp,” said the other.</p>

<p>The tinkle of glass followed as he removed the
chimney, and in the yellow light Bat faced the
“Borough Lot.”</p>

<p>“U—P spells ‘up,’ an’ that’s what the game
is,” he said calmly. He was searching his
pockets as he spoke. “I want a light because
there’s one or two things in my pocket that I’ve
got to burn—quick!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>After some fumbling he found a paper. He
gave it a swift examination, then he struck a
match and carefully lit the corner.</p>

<p>“It’s the fairest cop,” he went on. “The
street’s full of police, and Angel ain’t playing
‘gamblin’ raids’ this time.”</p>

<p>There was a heavy knock on the door, but nobody
moved. Goyle’s face had gone livid. He
knew better than any man there how impossible
escape was. That had been one of the drawbacks
to the house—the ease with which it could
be surrounded. He had pointed out the fact to
Connor before.</p>

<p>Again the knock.</p>

<p>“Let ’em open it,” said Bat grimly, and as
though the people outside had heard the invitation,
the door crashed in, and there came a patter
as of men running on the stairs.</p>

<p>First to enter the room was Angel. He nodded
to Bat coolly, then stepped aside to allow the
policemen to follow.</p>

<p>“I want you,” he said briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>“What for?” asked Sands.</p>

<p>“Breaking and entering,” said the detective.
“Put out your hands!”</p>

<p>Bat obeyed. As the steel stirrup-shaped irons
snapped on his wrists he asked—</p>

<p>“Have you got Connor?”</p>

<p>Angel smiled.</p>

<p>“Connor lives to fight another day,” he said
quietly.</p>

<p>The policemen who attended him were busy
with the other occupants of the room.</p>

<p>“Bit of a field-day for you, Mr. Angel,” said
the thin-faced Lamby pleasantly. “Thought you
was goin’ to let us off?”</p>

<p>“Jumping at conclusions hastily is a habit to be
deplored,” said Angel sententiously. Then he
saw the panic-stricken Mr. Lane.</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s this?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane had at that moment the inspiration
of his life. Since he was by fortuitous circumstances
involved in this matter, and since it could
make very little difference one way or the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
what he said, he seized the fame that lay to his
hand.</p>

<p>“I am one of the ‘Borough Lot,’” he said,
and was led out proud and handcuffed with the
knowledge that he had established beyond dispute
his title to consideration as a desperate criminal.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Mr. Spedding was a man who thought quickly.
Ideas and plans came to him as dross and diamonds
come to the man at the sorting table, and
he had the faculty of selection. He saw the
police system of England as only the police themselves
saw it, and he had an open mind upon
Angel’s action. It was within the bounds of possibility
that Angel had acted with full authority;
it was equally possible that Angel was bluffing.</p>

<p>Mr. Spedding had two courses before him, and
they were both desperate; but he must be sure in
how, so far, his immediate liberty depended upon
the whim of a deputy-assistant-commissioner of
police.</p>

<p>Angel had mentioned a supreme authority. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
was characteristic of Spedding that he should
walk into a mine to see how far the fuse had
burned. In other words, he hailed the first cab,
and drove to the House of Commons.</p>

<p>The Right Honorable George Chandler
Middleborough, His Majesty’s Secretary of State
for Home Affairs, is a notoriously inaccessible
man; but he makes exceptions, and such an exception
he made in favor of Spedding. For
eminent solicitors do not come down to the House
at ten o’clock in the evening to gratify an idle
curiosity, or to be shown over the House, or beg
patronage and interest; and when a business card
is marked “most urgent,” and that card stands
for a staple representative of an important profession,
the request for an interview is not easily
refused.</p>

<p>Spedding was shown into the minister’s room,
and the Home Secretary rose with a smile. He
knew Mr. Spedding by sight, and had once dined
in his company.</p>

<p>“Er—” he began, looking at the card in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
hand, “what can I do for you—at this hour?” he
smiled again.</p>

<p>“I have called to see you in the matter of the
late—er—Mr. Reale.” He saw and watched the
minister’s face. Beyond looking a little puzzled,
the Home Secretary made no sign.</p>

<p>“Good!” thought Spedding, and breathed with
more freedom.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid——” said the minister. He got
no further, for Spedding was at once humility,
apology, and embarrassment.</p>

<p>What! had the Home Secretary not received
his letter? A letter dealing with the estate of
Reale? You can imagine the distress and vexation
on Mr. Spedding’s face as he spoke of the
criminal carelessness of his clerk, his attitude of
helplessness, his recognition of the absolute impossibility
of discussing the matter until the
Secretary had received the letter, and his withdrawal,
leaving behind him a sympathetic minister
of State who would have been pleased—would
have been delighted, my dear sir, to have helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Mr. Spedding if he’d received the letter in time
to consider its contents. Mr. Spedding was an
inventive genius, and it might have been in reference
to him that the motherhood of invention was
first identified with dire necessity.</p>

<p>Out again in the courtyard, Spedding found a
cab that carried him to his club.</p>

<p>“Angel bluffed!” he reflected with an inward
smile. “My friend, you are risking that nice
appointment of yours.”</p>

<p>He smiled again, for it occurred to him that his
risk was the greater.</p>

<p>“Two millions!” he murmured. “It is worth
it: I could do a great deal with two millions.”</p>

<p>He got down at his club, and tendered the cabman
the legal fare to a penny.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE QUEST OF THE BOOK</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Piccadilly Circus, a blaze of light, was
thronged with the crowds that the theaters were
discharging, a motor-car came gingerly through
the traffic, passed down Regent Street, and
swinging along Pall Mall, headed southward
across Westminster Bridge.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, but underfoot the roads
were sodden, and the car bespattered its occupants
with black mud.</p>

<p>The chauffeur at the wheel turned as the car
ran smoothly along the tramway lines in the Old
Kent Road and asked a question, and one of the
two men in the back of the car consulted the
other.</p>

<p>“We will go to Cramer’s first,” said the man.</p>

<p>Old Kent Road was a fleeting vision of closed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
shops, of little knots of men emerging from
public-houses at the potman’s strident command;
Lewisham High Road, as befits that very respectable
thoroughfare, was decorously sleeping;
Lea, where the hedges begin, was silent; and
Chislehurst was a place of the dead.</p>

<p>Near the common the car pulled up at a big
house standing in black quietude, and the two
occupants of the car descended and passed
through the stiff gate, along the graveled path,
and came to a stop at the broad porch.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what old Mauder will say,”
said Angel as he fumbled for the bell; “he’s a
methodical old chap.”</p>

<p>In the silence they could hear the thrill of the
electric bell. They waited a few minutes, and
rang again. Then they heard a window opened
and a sleepy voice demand—</p>

<p>“Who is there?”</p>

<p>Angel stepped back from the porch and looked
up.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mauder! I want you. I’m Angel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“The devil!” said a surprised voice. “Wait
a bit. I’ll be down in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>The pleasant-faced man who in dressing-gown
and pajamas opened the door to them and conducted
them to a cozy library was Mr. Ernest
Mauder himself. It is unnecessary to introduce
that world-famous publisher to the reader, the
more particularly in view of the storm of controversy
that burst about his robust figure in
regard to the recent publication of Count Lehoff’s
embarrassing “Memoirs.” He made a sign to
the two men to be seated, nodding to Jimmy as
to an old friend.</p>

<p>“I am awfully sorry to disturb you at this
rotten hour,” Angel commenced, and the other
arrested his apology with a gesture.</p>

<p>“You detective people are so fond of springing
surprises on us unintelligent outsiders,” he said,
with a twinkle in his eye, “that I am almost
tempted to startle you.”</p>

<p>“It takes a lot to startle me,” said Angel complacently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“You’ve brought it on your own head,”
warned the publisher, wagging a forefinger at the
smiling Angel. “Now let me tell you why you
have motored down from London on this miserable
night on a fairly fruitless errand.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” The smile left Angel’s face.</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought that would startle you! You’ve
come about a book?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jimmy wonderingly.</p>

<p>“A book published by our people nine years
ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the wonderment deepening on the faces
of the two men.</p>

<p>“The title,” said the publisher impressively,
“is <i>A Short Study on the Origin of the Alphabet</i>,
and the author is a half-mad old don, who was
subsequently turned out of Oxford for drunkenness.”</p>

<p>“Mauder,” said Jimmy, gazing at his host in
bewilderment, “you’ve hit it—but——”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the publisher, triumphant, “I
thought that was it. Well, your search is fruitless.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
We only printed five hundred copies; the
book was a failure—the same ground was more
effectively covered by better books. I found a
dusty old copy a few years ago, and gave it to my
secretary. So far as I know, that is the only
copy in existence.”</p>

<p>“But your secretary?” said Angel eagerly.
“What is his name? Where does he
live?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a ‘he,’” said Mauder, “but a
‘she.’”</p>

<p>“Her name?”</p>

<p>“If you had asked that question earlier in the
evening I could not have told you,” said Mauder,
obviously enjoying the mystery he had created,
“but since then my memory has been refreshed.
The girl—and a most charming lady too—was
my secretary for two years. I do not know what
induced her to work, but I rather think she supported
an invalid father.”</p>

<p>“What is her name?” asked Angel impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>“Kathleen Kent,” replied the publisher, “and
her address is——”</p>

<p>“Kathleen Kent!” repeated Jimmy in wide-eyed
astonishment. “Angels and Ministers of
Grace defend us!”</p>

<p>“Kathleen Kent!” repeated Angel with a gasp.
“Well, that takes the everlasting biscuit! But,”
he added quickly, “how did you come to know of
our errand?”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled the elder man, wrapping his
dressing-gown round him more snugly, “it was
a guess to an extent. You see, Angel, when a
man has been already awakened out of a sound
sleep to answer mysterious inquiries about an out-of-date
book——”</p>

<p>“What,” cried Jimmy, jumping up, “somebody
has already been here?”</p>

<p>“It is only natural,” the publisher went on, “to
connect his errand with that of the second midnight
intruder.”</p>

<p>“Who has been here? For Heaven’s sake,
don’t be funny; this is a serious business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>“Nobody has been here,” said Mauder, “but
an hour ago a man called me up on the telephone——”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at Angel, and Angel looked at
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said Angel penitently, “write me
down as a fool. Telephone! Heavens, I didn’t
know you were connected.”</p>

<p>“Nor was I till last week,” said the publisher,
“nor will I be after to-morrow. Sleep is too
precious a gift to be dissipated——”</p>

<p>“Who was the man?” demanded Angel.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t quite catch his name. He was
very apologetic. I gathered that he was a newspaper
man, and wanted particulars in connection
with the death of the author.”</p>

<p>Angel smiled.</p>

<p>“The author’s alive all right,” he said grimly.
“How did the voice sound—a little pompous,
with a clearing of the throat before each
sentence?”</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>“Spedding!” said Angel, rising. “We
haven’t any time to lose, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Mauder accompanied them into the hall.</p>

<p>“One question,” said Jimmy, as he fastened
the collar of his motor-coat. “Can you give us
any idea of the contents of the book?”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” was the reply. “I have a dim recollection
that much of it was purely conventional,
that there were some rough drawings, and the
earlier forms of the alphabet were illustrated—the
sort of thing you find in encyclopædias or in
the back pages of teachers’ Bibles.”</p>

<p>The two men took their seats in the car as it
swung round and turned its bright head-lamps
toward London.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘I found this puzzle in a book</div>
<div class="verse">From which some mighty truths were took,’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>murmured Angel in his companion’s ear, and
Jimmy nodded. He was at that moment utterly
oblivious and careless of the fortune that awaited
them in the great safe at Lombard Street. His
mind was filled with anxiety concerning the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
who unconsciously held the book which might to-morrow
make her an heiress. Spedding had
moved promptly, and he would be aided, he did
not doubt, by Connor and the ruffians of the
“Borough Lot.” If the book was still in the
girl’s possession they would have it, and they
would make their attempt at once.</p>

<p>His mind was full of dark forebodings, and
although the car bounded through the night at
full speed, and the rain which had commenced to
fall again cut his face, and the momentum of the
powerful machine took his breath away, it went
all too slowly for his mood.</p>

<p>One incident relieved the monotony of the
journey. As the car flew round a corner in an
exceptionally narrow lane it almost crashed into
another car, which, driven at breakneck speed,
was coming in the opposite direction. A fleeting
exchange of curses between the chauffeurs, and
the cars passed.</p>

<p>By common consent, they had headed for Kathleen’s
home. Streatham was deserted. As they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
turned the corner of the quiet road in which the
girl lived, Angel stopped the car and alighted. He
lifted one of the huge lamps from the socket and
examined the road.</p>

<p>“There has been a car here less than half an
hour ago,” he said, pointing to the unmistakable
track of wheels. They led to the door of the
house.</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and it was almost immediately
answered by an elderly lady, who, wrapped
in a loose dressing-gown, bade him enter.</p>

<p>“Nobody seems to be surprised to see us to-night,”
thought Angel with bitter humor.</p>

<p>“I am Detective Angel from Scotland Yard,”
he announced himself, and the elderly lady seemed
unimpressed.</p>

<p>“Kathleen has gone,” she informed him cheerfully.</p>

<p>Jimmy heard her with a sinking at his
heart.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the old lady, “Mr. Spedding, the
eminent solicitor, called for her an hour ago,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
and”—she grew confidential—“as I know you
gentlemen are very much interested in the case,
I may say that there is every hope that before
to-morrow my niece will be in possession of her
fortune.”</p>

<p>Jimmy groaned.</p>

<p>“Please, go on,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“It came about over a book which Kathleen
had given her some years ago, and which most
assuredly would have been lost but for my carefulness.”</p>

<p>Jimmy cursed her “carefulness” under his
breath.</p>

<p>“When we moved here after the death of
Kathleen’s poor father I had a great number of
things stored. There were amongst these an
immense quantity of books, which Kathleen
would have sold, but which I thought——”</p>

<p>“Where are these stored?” asked Angel
quickly.</p>

<p>“At an old property of ours—the only property
that my poor brother had remaining,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
replied sadly, “and that because it was in too
dilapidated a condition to attract buyers.”</p>

<p>“Where, where?” Angel realized the rudeness
of his impatience. “Forgive me, madam,”
he said, “but it is absolutely necessary that I
should follow your niece at once.”</p>

<p>“It is on the Tonbridge Road,” she answered
stiffly. “So far as I can remember, it is somewhere
between Crawley and Tonbridge, but I am
not sure. Kathleen knows the place well; that is
why she has gone.”</p>

<p>“Somewhere on the Tonbridge Road!” repeated
Angel helplessly.</p>

<p>“We could follow the car’s tracks,” said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>Angel shook his head.</p>

<p>“If this rain is general, they will be obliterated,”
he replied.</p>

<p>They stood a minute, Jimmy biting the sodden
finger of his glove, and Angel staring into
vacancy. Then Jimmy demanded unexpectedly—</p>

<p>“Have you a Bible?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The old lady allowed the astonishment she felt
at the question to be apparent.</p>

<p>“I have several.”</p>

<p>“A teacher’s Bible, with notes?” he asked.</p>

<p>She thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is such an one in the house. Will
you wait?”</p>

<p>She left the room.</p>

<p>“We should have told the girl about Spedding—we
should have told her,” said Angel in despair.</p>

<p>“It’s no use crying over spilt milk,” said
Jimmy quietly. “The thing to do now is to frustrate
Spedding and rescue the girl.”</p>

<p>“Will he dare——?”</p>

<p>“He’ll dare. Oh, yes, he’ll dare,” said Jimmy.
“He’s worse than you think, Angel.”</p>

<p>“But he is already a ruined man.”</p>

<p>“The more reason why he should go a step
further. He’s been on the verge of ruin for
months, I’ve found that out. I made inquiries
the other day, and discovered he’s in a hole that
the dome of St. Paul’s wouldn’t fill. He’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
trustee or something of the sort for an association
that has been pressing him for money. Spedding
will dare anything”—he paused then—“but if
he dares to harm that girl he’s a dead man.”</p>

<p>The old lady came in at that moment with the
book, and Jimmy hastily turned over the pages.</p>

<p>Near the end he came upon something that
brought a gleam to his eye.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his pocket and drew
out a notebook. He did not wait to pull up a
chair, but sank on his knees by the side of the
table and wrote rapidly, comparing the text with
the drawings in the book.</p>

<p>Angel, leaning over, followed the work breathlessly.</p>

<p>“There—and there—and there!” cried Angel
exultantly. “What fools we were, Jimmy, what
fools we were.”</p>

<p>Jimmy turned to the lady.</p>

<p>“May I borrow this book?” he asked. “It
will be returned. Thank you. Now, Angel,” he
looked at his watch and made a move for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
door, “we have two hours. We will take the
Tonbridge Road by daybreak.”</p>

<p>Only one other person did they disturb on that
eventful night, and that was a peppery old Colonel
of Marines, who lived at Blackheath.</p>

<p>There, before the hastily-attired old officer, as
the dawn broke, Angel explained his mission, and
writing with feverish haste, subscribed to the
written statement by oath. Whereupon the Justice
of the Peace issued a warrant for the arrest
of Joseph James Spedding, Solicitor, on a charge
of felony.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED AT FLAIRBY MILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kathleen</span> very naturally regarded the lawyer
in the light of a disinterested friend. There was
no reason why she should not do so; and if there
had been any act needed to kindle a kindly feeling
for the distant legal adviser it was this last act
of his, for no sooner, as he told her, had he discovered
by the merest accident a clue to the hidden
word, than he had rushed off post-haste to
put her in possession of his information. He had
naturally advised immediate action, and when
she demurred at the lateness of the hour at which
to begin a hunt for the book, he had hinted
vaguely at difficulties which would beset her if
she delayed. She wanted to let Angel know, and
Jimmy, but this the lawyer would not hear of, and
she accounted for the insistence of his objection
by the cautiousness of the legal mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>Then the excitement of the midnight adventure
appealed to her—the swift run in the motor-car
through the wild night, and the wonderful possibilities
of the search at the end of the ride.</p>

<p>So she went, and her appetite for adventure
was all but satisfied by a narrowly-averted collision
with another car speeding in the opposite
direction. She did not see the occupants of the
other car, but she hoped they had had as great
a fright as she.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, neither of the two men
had given a second thought to their danger; one’s
mind was entirely and completely filled with her
image, and the other was brooding on telephones.</p>

<p>She had no time to tire of the excitement of
the night—the run across soaking heaths and
through dead villages, where little cottages
showed up for a moment in the glare of the headlights,
then faded into the darkness. Too soon
she came to a familiar stretch of the road, and the
car slowed down so that they might not pass the
tiny grass lane that led to Flairby Mill. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
came to it at last, and the car bumped cautiously
over deep cart ruts, over loose stones, and through
long drenched grasses till there loomed out of the
night the squat outlines of Flairby Mill.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, before the coming of cheap
machinery, Flairby Mill had been famous in the
district, and the rumble of its big stones went on
incessantly, night and day; but the wheel had long
since broken, its wreck lay in the bed of the little
stream that had so faithfully served it; its machinery
was rust and scrap iron, and only the tiny
dwelling-house that adjoined was of value. With
little or no repair the homestead had remained
watertight and weatherproof, and herein had
Kathleen stored the odds and ends of her father’s
household. The saddles, shields, spears, and oddments
he had collected in his travels, and the
modest library that had consoled the embittered
years of his passing, were all stored here. Valueless
as the world assesses value, but in the eyes of
the girl precious things associated with her dead
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>The tears rose to her eyes as Spedding, taking
the key from her hand, fitted it into the lock of a
seventeenth-century door, but she wiped them
away furtively.</p>

<p>Spedding utilized the acetylene lamp of the car
to show him the way into the house. “You must
direct me, Miss Kent,” he said, and Kathleen
pointed the way. Up the oaken stairs, covered
with dust, their footsteps resounding hollowly
through the deserted homestead, the two passed.
At the head of the stairs was a heavy door, and
acting under the girl’s instructions, the lawyer
opened this.</p>

<p>It was a big room, almost like a barn, with a
timbered ceiling sloping downward. There were
three shuttered windows, and another door at
the farther end of the room that led to a smaller
room.</p>

<p>“This was the miller’s living room,” she said
sadly. She could just remember when a miller
lived in the homestead, and when she had ridden
up to the door of the mill accompanied by her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
father, and the miller, white and jovial, had lifted
her down and taken her through a mysterious
chamber where great stones turned laboriously
and noisily, and the air was filled with a fine white
dust.</p>

<p>Spedding placed the lamp on the table, and cast
his eyes round the room in search of the books.
They were not difficult to discover; they had been
unpacked, and were ranged in three disorderly
rows upon roughly constructed bookshelves. The
lawyer turned the lamp so that the full volume of
light should fall on the books. Then he went
carefully over them, row by row, checking each
copy methodically, and half muttering the name
of each tome he handled. There were school
books, works of travel, and now and again a
heavily bound scientific treatise, for her father
had made science a particular study. The girl
stood with one hand resting on the table, looking
on, admiring the patience of the smooth, heavy
man at his task, and, it must be confessed, inwardly
wondering what necessity there was for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
this midnight visitation. She had told the lawyer
nothing about the red envelope, but instinctively
felt that he knew all about it.</p>

<p>“<i>Anabasis</i>, Xenophon,” he muttered; “Josephus,
<i>Works and Life</i>; <i>Essays of Elia</i>; <i>Essays</i>,
Emerson; <i>Essays</i>, De Quincey. What’s
this?”</p>

<p>He drew from between two bulky volumes a
thin little book with a discolored cover. He
dusted it carefully, glanced at the title, opened it
and read the title-page, then walked back to the
table and seated himself, and started to read the
book.</p>

<p>The girl did not know why, but there was
something in his attitude at that moment that
caused her a little uneasiness, and stirred within
her a sense of danger. Perhaps it was that up
till then he had shown her marked deference, had
been almost obsequious. Now that the book had
been found he disregarded her. He did not bring
it to her or invite her attention, and she felt that
she was “out of the picture,” that the lawyer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
interest in her affairs had stopped dead just as
soon as the discovery was made.</p>

<p>He turned the leaves over carefully, poring
over the introduction, and her eyes wandered
from the book to his face. She had never looked
at him before with any critical interest. In the
unfriendly light of the lamp she saw his imperfections—the
brutal strength of his jaw, the unscrupulous
thinness of the lip, the heavy eyelids,
and the curious hairlessness of his face. She
shivered a little, for she read too much in his face
for her peace of mind.</p>

<p>Unconscious of her scrutiny, for the book before
him was all-engrossing, the lawyer went
from page to page.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think we had better be going?”
Kathleen asked timidly.</p>

<p>Spedding looked up, and his stare was in keeping
with his words.</p>

<p>“When I have finished we will go,” he said
brusquely, and went on reading.</p>

<p>Kathleen gave a little gasp of astonishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
for, with all her suspicions, she had not been prepared
for such a complete and instant dropping
of his mask of amiability. In a dim fashion she
began to realize her danger, yet there could be
no harm; outside was the chauffeur, he stood for
something of established order. She made another
attempt.</p>

<p>“I must insist, Mr. Spedding, upon your finishing
your examination of that book elsewhere. I
do not know whether you are aware that you are
occupying the only chair in the room,” she added
indignantly.</p>

<p>“I am very well aware,” said the lawyer
calmly, without raising his eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spedding!”</p>

<p>He looked up with an air of weariness.</p>

<p>“May I ask you to remain quiet until I have
finished,” he said, with an emphasis that she could
not mistake, “and lest you have any lingering
doubt that my present research is rather on my
own account than on yours, I might add that if
you annoy me by whining or fuming, or by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
such nonsensical tricks, I have that with me which
will quiet you,” and he resumed his reading.</p>

<p>Cold and white, the girl stood in silence, her
heart beating wildly, her mind occupied with
schemes of escape.</p>

<p>After a while the lawyer looked up and tapped
the book with his forefinger.</p>

<p>“Your precious secret is a secret no longer,”
he said with a hard laugh. Kathleen made no
answer. “If I hadn’t been a fool, I should have
seen through it before,” he added, then he looked
at the girl in meditation.</p>

<p>“I have two propositions before me,” he said,
“and I want your help.”</p>

<p>“You will have no help from me, Mr. Spedding,”
she replied coldly. “To-morrow you
will be asked to explain your extraordinary
conduct.”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, by whom? By Angel or the
young swell-mobsman who’s half in love with
you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>He laughed again as he saw the color rising to
the girl’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ve hit the mark, have I?”</p>

<p>She received his speech in contemptuous silence.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall be away—well away, I
trust, from the reach of either of the gentlemen
you mention. I am not concerned with to-morrow
as much as to-day.” She remembered
that they were within an hour of daybreak. “To-day
is a most fateful day for me—and for you.”
He emphasized the last words.</p>

<p>She preserved an icy silence.</p>

<p>“If I may put my case in a nutshell,” he went
on, with all his old-time suavity, “I may say that
it is necessary for me to secure the money that is
stored in that ridiculous safe.” She checked an
exclamation. “Ah! you understand? Let me
be more explicit. When I say get the money, I
mean get it for myself, every penny of it, and
convert it to my private use. You can have no
idea,” he went on, “how comforting it is to be
able to stand up and say in so many words the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
unspoken thoughts of a year, to tell some human
being the most secret things that I have so far
hidden here,” he struck his chest. “I had thought
when old Reale’s commission was intrusted to me
that I should find the legatees ordinary plain,
everyday fools, who would have unfolded to me
day by day the result of their investigations to
my profit. I did not reckon very greatly on you,
for women are naturally secretive and suspicious,
but I did rely upon the two criminals. My experience
of the criminal classes, a fairly extensive
one, led me to believe that with these gentry I
should have no difficulty.” He pursed his lips.
“I had calculated without my Jimmy,” he said
shortly. He saw the light in the girl’s eye.
“Yes,” he went on, “Jimmy is no ordinary man,
and Angel is a glaring instance of bad nomenclature.
I nearly had Jimmy once. Did he tell
you how he got the red envelope? I see he did
not. Well, I nearly had him. I went to look
for his body next morning, and found nothing.
Later in the day I received a picture postcard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
from him, of a particularly flippant and vulgar
character.” He stopped as if inviting comment.</p>

<p>“Your confessions have little interest for me,”
said the girl quietly. “I am now only anxious
to be rid of your presence.”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that,” said the lawyer. “I
was very rude to you a little while ago, but I was
busily engaged, and besides I desired to give you
an artistic introduction to the new condition.
Now, so far from being rude, I wish to be very
kind.”</p>

<p>In spite of her outward calm, she trembled at
the silky tone the lawyer had now adopted.</p>

<p>“My position is this,” he said, “there is an
enormous sum of money, which rightly is yours.
The law and the inclination of your competitor—we
will exclude Connor, who is not a factor—give
you the money. It is unfortunate that I
also, who have no earthly right, should desire this
money, and we have narrowed down the ultimate
issue to this: Shall it be Spedding or Kathleen
Kent? I say Spedding, and circumstances support<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
my claim, for I have you here, and, if you
will pardon the suspicion of melodrama, very
much in my power. If I am to take the two millions,
<i>your</i> two millions, without interruption, it
will depend entirely upon you.”</p>

<p>Again he stopped to notice the effect of his
words. The girl made no response, but he could
see the terror in her eyes.</p>

<p>“If I could have dispensed with your services,
or if I had had the sense to guess the simple solution
of this cursed puzzle, I could have done
everything without embarrassing you in the
slightest; but now it has come to this—I have got
to silence you.”</p>

<p>He put forward the proposition with the utmost
coolness, and Kathleen felt her senses reel at all
the words implied.</p>

<p>“I can silence you by killing you,” he said
simply, “or by marrying you. If I could think
of some effective plan by which I might be sure
of your absolute obliteration for two days, I
would gladly adopt it; but you are a human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
woman, and that is too much to expect. Now, of
the alternatives, which do you prefer?”</p>

<p>She shrank back against the shuttered window,
her eyes on the man.</p>

<p>“You are doubtless thinking of the chauffeur,”
he said smoothly, “but you may leave him out of
the reckoning. Had your ears been sharp, you
would have heard the car going back half an hour
ago—he is awaiting our return half a mile away.
If I return alone he will doubtlessly be surprised,
but he will know nothing. Do you not see a picture
of him driving me away, and me, at his side
turning round and waving a smiling farewell to
an imaginary woman who is invisible to the chauffeur?
Picture his uneasiness vanishing with this
touch. Two days afterwards he would be on the
sea with me, ignorant of the murder, and curious
things happen at sea. Come, Kathleen, is it to be
marriage——?”</p>

<p>“Death!” she cried hoarsely, then, as his swift
hand caught her by the throat, she screamed.</p>

<p>His face looked down into hers, no muscle of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
moved. Fixed, rigid, and full of his dreadful
purpose, she saw the pupils of his pitiless eyes
contract.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden he released hold of her, and
she fell back against the wall.</p>

<p>She heard his quick breathing, and closing her
eyes, waited.</p>

<p>Then slowly she looked up. She saw a revolver
in his hand, and in a numb kind of way she
realized that it was not pointed at her.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” She heard Spedding’s harsh
shout. “Hands up, both of you!”</p>

<p>Then she heard an insolent laugh.</p>

<p>There were only two men in the world who
would laugh like that in the very face of death,
and they were both there, standing in the doorway,
Angel with his motor goggles about his
neck and Jimmy slowly peeling his gloves.</p>

<p>Then she looked at Spedding.</p>

<p>The hand that held the revolver did not
tremble, he was as self-possessed as he had been a
few minutes before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“If either of you move I’ll shoot the girl, by
God!” said Spedding through his teeth.</p>

<p>They stood in the doorway, and Jimmy spoke.
He did not raise his voice, but she heard the
slumbering passion vibrating through his quiet
sentences.</p>

<p>“Spedding, Spedding, my man, you’re frightening
that child; put your gun down and let us
talk. Do you hear me? I am keeping myself
in hand, Spedding, but if you harm that girl I’ll
be a devil to you. D’ye hear? If you hurt her,
I’ll take you with my bare hands and treat you
Indian fashion, Spedding, my man, tie you down
and stake you out, then burn you slowly. Yes,
and, by the Lord, if any man interferes, even if
it’s Angel here, I’ll swing for him. D’ye hear
that?”</p>

<p>His breast heaved with the effort to hold
himself, and Spedding, shuddering at the
ferocity in the man’s whole bearing, lowered his
pistol.</p>

<p>“Let us talk,” he said huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“That’s better,” said Angel, “and let me talk
first. I want you.”</p>

<p>“Come and take me,” he said.</p>

<p>“The risk is too great,” said Angel frankly,
“and besides, I can afford to wait.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked the lawyer defiantly, after a
long pause. He kept the weapon in his hand
pointed in the vicinity of the girl.</p>

<p>Angel exchanged a word in an undertone with
his companion, then—</p>

<p>“You may go,” he said, and stepped aside.</p>

<p>Spedding motioned him farther away. Then
slowly edging his way to the door, he reached it.
He paused for a moment as if about to speak,
then quick as thought raised his revolver and fired
twice.</p>

<p>Angel felt the wind of the bullets as they passed
his face, and sprang forward just as Jimmy’s arm
shot out.</p>

<p>Crack, crack, crack! Three shots so rapid that
their reports were almost simultaneous from
Jimmy’s automatic pistol sped after the lawyer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
but too late, and the heavy door crashed to in
Angel’s face, and the snap of the lock told them
they were prisoners.</p>

<p>Angel made a dart for a window, but it was
shuttered and nailed and immovable.</p>

<p>He looked at Jimmy, and burst into a ringing
laugh.</p>

<p>“Trapped, by Jove!” he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy was on his knees by the side of the girl.
She had not fainted, but had suddenly realized
her terrible danger, and the strain and weariness
of the night adventure had brought her trembling
to her knees. Very tenderly did Jimmy’s arm
support her. She felt the strength of the man,
and, thrilled at his touch, her head sank on his
shoulder and she felt at rest.</p>

<p>Angel was busily examining the windows, when
a loud report outside the house arrested his attention.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked the girl faintly.</p>

<p>“It is either Mr. Spedding’s well-timed suicide,
which I fear is too much to expect,” said Angel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
philosophically, “or else it is the same Mr. Spedding
destroying the working parts of our car. I
am afraid it is the latter.”</p>

<p>He moved up and down the room, examined
the smaller chamber at the other end, then sniffed
uneasily.</p>

<p>“Miss Kent,” he said earnestly, “are you well
enough to tell me something?”</p>

<p>She started and flushed as she drew herself
from Jimmy’s arms, and stood up a little shakily.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, with a faint smile, “I think
I am all right now.”</p>

<p>“What is there under here?” asked Angel,
pointing to the floor.</p>

<p>“An old workshop, a sort of storehouse,” she
replied in surprise.</p>

<p>“What is in it?” There was no mistaking
the seriousness in Angel’s voice.</p>

<p>“Broken furniture.”</p>

<p>“Mattresses?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think there are, and paints and things.
Why do you ask?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“Jimmy,” said Angel quickly, “do you smell
anything?”</p>

<p>Jimmy sniffed.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said quickly. “Quick, the windows!”</p>

<p>They made a rapid search of the room. In a
corner Jimmy unearthed a rusty cavalry saber.</p>

<p>“That’s the thing,” said Angel, and started to
prise loose the solid shutter; but the wood was
unyielding, and just as they had secured a purchase
the blade snapped.</p>

<p>“There is an old ax in the cupboard,” cried
the girl, who apprehended the hidden danger.</p>

<p>With a yell of joy Angel dragged forth an antiquated
battle-ax, and attacked the shutter afresh.
With each blow the wood flew in big splinters, but
fast as he worked something else was moving
faster. Angel had not mistaken the smell of
petrol, and now a thin vapor of smoke flowed into
the room from underneath the door, and in tiny
spirals through the interstices of the floorboards.
Angel stopped exhausted, and Jimmy picked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
the ax and struck it true, then after one vigorous
stroke a streak of daylight showed in the shutter.
The room was now intolerably hot, and Angel
took up the ax and hacked away at the oaken
barrier to life.</p>

<p>“Shall we escape?” asked the girl quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” said Jimmy steadily.</p>

<p>“I shall not regret to-night,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” said Jimmy in a low voice, “whatever
the issue is. It is very good to love once in a
lifetime, even if that once is on the brink of the
grave.”</p>

<p>Her lips quivered, and she tried to speak.</p>

<p>Angel was hard at work on the window, and
his back was toward them, and Jimmy bent and
kissed the girl on the lips.</p>

<p>The window was down! Angel turned in a
welter of perspiring triumph.</p>

<p>“Outside as quick as dammit!” he cried.</p>

<p>Angel had found a rope in the smaller room in
his earlier search, and this he slipped round the
girl’s waist. “When you get down run clear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
the smoke,” he instructed her, and in a minute
she found herself swinging in mid-air, in a cloud
of rolling smoke that blinded and choked her.
She felt the ground, and staying only to loose the
rope, she ran outward and fell exhausted on a
grassy bank.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the two men were by her side.</p>

<p>They stood in silence contemplating the conflagration,
then Kathleen remembered.</p>

<p>“The book, the book!” she cried.</p>

<p>“It’s inside my shirt,” said the shameless
Angel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>CONNOR TAKES A HAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is an axiom at Scotland Yard, “Beware of
an audience.” Enemies of our police system advance
many and curious reasons for this bashfulness.
In particular they place a sinister interpretation
upon the desire of the police to carry
out their work without fuss and without ostentation,
for the police have an embarrassing system
of midnight arrests. Unless you advertise the
fact, or unless your case is of sufficient importance
to merit notice in the evening newspapers, there
is no reason why your disappearance from society
should excite comment, or why the excuse, put
forward for your absence from your accustomed
haunts, that you have gone abroad should not be
accepted without question.</p>

<p>Interviewing his wise chief, Angel received
some excellent advice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>“If you’ve got to arrest him, do it quietly. If,
as you suggest, he barricades himself in his house,
or takes refuge in his patent vault, leave him
alone. We want no fuss, and we want no newspaper
sensations. If you can square up the Reale
business without arresting him, by all means do
so. We shall probably get him in—er—what do
you call it, Angel?—oh, yes, ‘the ordinary way
of business.’”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Angel, nothing loth to
carry out the plan.</p>

<p>“From what I know of this class of man,” the
Assistant-Commissioner went on, fingering his
grizzled mustache, “he will do nothing. He will
go about his daily life as though nothing had
happened; you will find him in his office this
morning, and if you went to arrest him you’d be
shot dead. No, if you take my advice you’ll leave
him severely alone for the present. He won’t
run away.”</p>

<p>So Angel thanked his chief and departed.</p>

<p>Throughout the morning he was obsessed by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
desire to see the lawyer. By midday this had
become so overmastering that he put on his hat
and sauntered down to Lincoln’s Inn Fields.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Spedding was in,” said a sober
clerk, and—after consulting his employer—“Mr.
Spedding would see him.”</p>

<p>The lawyer was sitting behind a big desk covered
with be-ribboned bundles of papers. He
greeted Angel with a smile, and pointed to a chair
on the other side of the desk.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in court most of the morning,” he
said blandly, “but I’m at liberty for half an hour.
What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>Angel looked at him in undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>“You’re a wonderful chap,” he said with a
shake of his head.</p>

<p>“You’re admiring me,” said the lawyer, fingering
a paper-knife, “in very much the same way
as an enthusiastic naturalist admires the markings
of a horned viper.”</p>

<p>“That is very nicely put,” said Angel truthfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>The lawyer had dropped his eyes on to the desk
before him; then he looked up.</p>

<p>“What is it to be?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A truce,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“I thought you would say that,” replied Spedding
comfortably, “because I suppose you
know——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Angel with nonchalant ease,
“I know that the right hand which is so carelessly
reposing on your knee holds a weapon of
remarkable precision.”</p>

<p>“You are well advised,” said the lawyer, with
a slight bow.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Angel, “there is a warrant
in existence for your arrest.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed Spedding politely.</p>

<p>“I got it as a precautionary measure,” Angel
went on in his most affable manner.</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said the lawyer; “and now——”</p>

<p>“Oh, now,” said Angel, “I wanted to give you
formal notice that, on behalf of Miss Kent, we
intend opening the safe to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>“I will be there,” said the lawyer, and rang a
bell.</p>

<p>“And,” added Angel in a lower voice, “keep
out of Jimmy’s way.”</p>

<p>Spedding’s lips twitched, the only sign of nervousness
he had shown during the interview, but
he made no reply. As the clerk stood waiting at
the open door, Spedding, with his most gracious
smile, said—</p>

<p>“Er—and did you get home safely this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Quite, thank you,” replied Angel, in no wise
perturbed by the man’s audacity.</p>

<p>“Did you find your country quarters—er—comfortable?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly,” said Angel, rising to the occasion,
“but the function was a failure.”</p>

<p>“The function?” The lawyer bit at the bait
Angel had thrown.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the detective, his hand on the door,
“the house-warming, you know.”</p>

<p>Angel chuckled to himself all the way back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
the Embankment. His grim little jest pleased
him so much that he must needs call in and
tell his chief, and the chief’s smile was very
flattering.</p>

<p>“You’re a bright boy,” he said, “but when the
day comes for you to arrest that lawyer gentleman,
I trust you will, as a precautionary measure,
purge your soul of all frivolities, and prepare
yourself for a better world.”</p>

<p>“If,” said Angel, “I do not see the humorous
side of being killed, I shall regard my life as
badly ended.”</p>

<p>“Get out,” ordered the Commissioner, and
Angel got.</p>

<p>He realized as the afternoon wore on that he
was very tired, and snatched a couple of hours’
sleep before keeping the appointment he had
made with Jimmy earlier in the day. Whilst he
was dressing Jimmy came in—Jimmy rather
white, with a surgical bandage round his head,
and carrying with him the pungent scent of iodoform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>“Hullo,” said Angel in astonishment, “what
on earth have you been doing?”</p>

<p>Jimmy cast an eye round the room in search of
the most luxurious chair before replying.</p>

<p>“Ah,” he said with a sigh of contentment as
he seated himself, “that’s better.”</p>

<p>Angel pointed to the bandage.</p>

<p>“When did this happen?”</p>

<p>“An hour or so ago,” said Jimmy. “Spedding
is a most active man.”</p>

<p>Angel whistled.</p>

<p>“Conventionally?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Artistically,” responded Jimmy, nodding his
bandaged head. “A runaway motor-car that
followed my cab—beautifully done. The cab
horse was killed and the driver has a concussion,
but I saw the wheeze and jumped.”</p>

<p>“Got the chauffeur?” asked Angel anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes; it was in the City. You know the City
police? Well, they had him in three seconds.
He tried to bolt, but that’s a fool’s game in the
City.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Was it Spedding’s chauffeur?”</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled pityingly.</p>

<p>“Of course not. That’s where the art of the
thing comes in.”</p>

<p>Angel looked grave for a minute.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to ‘pull’ our friend,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Meaning Spedding?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” said Jimmy. “It
would be ever so much more comfortable for you
and me, but it will be ever so much better to finish
up the Reale business first.”</p>

<p>“Great minds!” murmured Angel, remembering
his chief’s advice. “I suppose Mr. Spedding
will lay for me to-night.”</p>

<p>“You can bet your life on that,” said Jimmy
cheerfully.</p>

<p>As he was speaking, a servant came into the
room with a letter. When the man had gone,
Angel opened and read it. His grin grew broader
as he perused it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“Listen!” he said. “It’s from Miss Kent.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was all attention.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Dear Mr. Angel,<br>
</p>

<p>“Spedding has trapped me again. Whilst
I was shopping this afternoon, two men came
up to me and asked me to accompany them.
They said they were police officers, and wanted
me in connection with last night’s affair. I was
so worried that I went with them. They took
me to a strange house in Kensington....
For Heaven’s sake, come to me!...”</p>
</div>

<p>Jimmy’s face was so white that Angel thought
he would faint.</p>

<p>“The hounds!” he cried. “Angel, we
must——”</p>

<p>“You must sit down,” said Angel, “or you’ll
be having a fit.” He examined the letter again.
“It’s beautifully done,” he said. “Scrawled on
a torn draper’s bill in pencil, it might very easily
be her writing.”</p>

<p>He put the missive carefully in a drawer of his
desk, and locked it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>“Unfortunately for the success of <i>that</i> scheme,
Mr. Spedding, I have four men watching Miss
Kent’s house day and night, and being in telephonic
communication, I happen to know that
that young lady has not left her house all
day.”</p>

<p>He looked at Jimmy, white and shaking.</p>

<p>“Buck up, Jimmy!” he said kindly. “Your
bang on the head has upset you more than you
think.”</p>

<p>“But the letter?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“A little fake,” said Angel airily, “Mr. Spedding’s
little <i>ballon d’essai</i>, so foolishly simple that
I think Spedding must be losing his nerve and
balance. I’d like to bet that this house is being
watched to see the effect of the note.” (Angel
would have won his bet.) “Now the only question
is, what little program have they arranged
for me this evening?”</p>

<p>Jimmy was thoughtful.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said slowly, “but I should
think it would be wiser for you to keep indoors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
You might make me up a bed in your sitting-room,
and if there is any bother, we can share it.”</p>

<p>“And whistle to keep my courage up?”
sneered Angel. “I’ll make you up a bed with all
the pleasure in life; but I’m going out, Jimmy,
and I’ll take you with me, if you’ll agree to come
along and find a man who will replace that conspicuous
white bandage by something less blood-curdling.”</p>

<p>They found a man in Devonshire Place who
was a mutual friend of both. He was a specialist
in unpronounceable diseases, a Knight Commander
of St. Michael and St. George, a Fellow
of the two Colleges, and the author of half a
dozen works of medical science. Angel addressed
him as “Bill.”</p>

<p>The great surgeon deftly dressed the damaged
head of Jimmy, and wisely asked no questions.
He knew them both, and had been at Oxford
with one, and he permitted himself to indulge in
caustic comments on their mode of life and the
possibilities of their end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“If you didn’t jaw so much,” said Angel, “I’d
employ you regularly; as it is, I am very doubtful
if I shall ever bring you another case.”</p>

<p>“For which,” said Sir William Farran, as he
clipped the loose ends of the dressing, “I am
greatly obliged to you, Angel Esquire. You are
the sort of patient I like to see about once a year—just
about Christmas-time, when I am surfeited
with charity toward mankind, when I need a
healthy moral corrective to tone down the bright
picture to its normal grayness—that’s the time
you’re welcome, Angel.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Angel ecstatically. “I’d like to
see that sentence in a book, with illustrations.”</p>

<p>The surgeon smiled good-humoredly. He put
a final touch to the dressing.</p>

<p>“There you are,” he said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Bill,” said Jimmy. “You’re
getting fat.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for nothing,” said the surgeon
indignantly.</p>

<p>Angel struck a more serious tone when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
asked the surgeon in an undertone, just as they
were taking their departure—</p>

<p>“Where will you be to-night?”</p>

<p>The surgeon consulted a little engagement
book.</p>

<p>“I am dining at the ‘Ritz’ with some people
at eight. We are going on to the Gaiety afterwards,
and I shall be home by twelve. Why?”</p>

<p>“There’s a gentleman,” said Angel confidentially,
“who will make a valiant attempt to kill
one of us, or both of us to-night, and he might
just fail; so it would be as well to know where
you are, if you are wanted. Mind you,” added
Angel with a grin, “you might be wanted for
<i>him</i>.”</p>

<p>“You’re a queer bird,” said the surgeon, “and
Jimmy’s a queerer one. Well, off you go, you
two fellows; you’ll be getting my house a bad
name.”</p>

<p>Outside in the street the two ingrates continued
their discussion on the corpulency that attends
success in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>They walked leisurely to Piccadilly, and turned
towards the circus. It is interesting to record
the fact that for no apparent reason they struck
off into side streets, made unexpected excursions
into adjoining squares, took unnecessary short
cuts through mews, and finally, finding themselves
at the Oxford Street end of Charing Cross Road,
they hailed a hansom, and drove eastward rapidly.
Angel shouted up some directions through the
trap in the roof.</p>

<p>“I am moved to give the two gentlemen
who are following me what in sporting parlance
is called ‘a run for their money,’” he
said.</p>

<p>He lifted the flap at the back of the cab, glanced
through the little window, and groaned. Then
he gave fresh directions to the cabman.</p>

<p>“Drive to the ‘Troc,’” he called, and to Jimmy
he added, “If we must die, let us die full of good
food.”</p>

<p>In the thronged grill-room of the brightly-lighted
restaurant the two men found a table so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
placed that it commanded a view of the room.
They took their seats, and whilst Jimmy ordered
the dinner Angel watched the stream of people
entering.</p>

<p>He saw a dapper little man, with swarthy face
and coal-black eyes, eyebrows and mustache, come
through the glass doors. He stood for a breathing
space at the door, his bright eyes flashing
from face to face. Then he caught Angel’s
steady gaze, and his eyes rested a little longer on
the pair. Then Angel beckoned him. He hesitated
for a second, then walked slowly toward
them.</p>

<p>Jimmy pulled a chair from the table, and again
he hesitated as if in doubt; then slowly he seated
himself, glancing from one to the other suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Callvet—ne c’est pas?” asked
Angel.</p>

<p>“That is my name,” the other answered in
French.</p>

<p>“Permit me to introduce myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>“I know you,” said the little man shortly.
“You are a detective.”</p>

<p>“It is my fortune,” said Angel, ignoring the
bitterness in the man’s tone.</p>

<p>“You wish to speak to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Angel. “First, I would ask
why you have been following us for the last
hour?”</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Monsieur is mistaken.”</p>

<p>Jimmy had been very quiet during the evening.
Now he addressed the Frenchman.</p>

<p>“Callvet,” he said briefly, “do you know who
I am?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are also a detective.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked him straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“I am not a detective, Callvet, as you well
know. I am”—he felt an unusual repugnance at
using the next words—“I am Jimmy of Cairo.
You know me?”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you,” said the man doggedly.</p>

<p>“What you are—now—I do not know,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
Jimmy contemptuously. “I have known you as
all things—as an ornament of the young Egypt
party, as a tout for Reale, as a trader in beastliness.”</p>

<p>The conversation was in colloquial French, and
Jimmy used a phrase which is calculated to raise
the hair of the most brazen scoundrel. But this
man shrugged his shoulders and rose to
go. Jimmy caught his sleeve and detained
him.</p>

<p>“Callvet,” he said, “go back to Mr. Spedding,
your employer, and tell him the job is too dangerous.
Tell him that one of the men, at least,
knows enough about you to send you to New
Caledonia, or else——”</p>

<p>“Or else?” demanded the man defiantly.</p>

<p>“Or else,” said Jimmy in his hesitating way,
“I’ll be sending word to the French Ambassador
that ‘Monsieur Plessey’ is in London.”</p>

<p>The face of the man turned a sickly green.</p>

<p>“Monsieur—je n’en vois pas la nécessité,” he
muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>“And who is Plessey?” asked Angel when the
man had gone.</p>

<p>“A murderer greatly wanted by the French
police,” said Jimmy, “and Spedding has well
chosen his instrument. Angel, there will be
trouble before the evening is over.”</p>

<p>They ate their dinner in silence, lingering over
the coffee. The Frenchman had taken a table at
the other side of the room. Once when Angel
went out he made as though to leave, but seeing
that Jimmy did not move, he changed his mind.</p>

<p>Angel dawdled through the sweet, and took an
unconscionable time over his coffee. Jimmy,
fretting to be gone, groaned as his volatile companion
ordered yet another liqueur.</p>

<p>“That’s horribly insidious muck to drink,”
grumbled Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Inelegant, but true,” said Angel.</p>

<p>He was amused at the obvious efforts of the
spy at the other table to kill time also. Then
suddenly Angel rose, leaving his drink untasted,
and reached for his hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Come along,” he said briskly.</p>

<p>“This is very sudden,” remarked the impatient
Jimmy.</p>

<p>They walked to the desk and paid their bill,
and out of the corner of his eye Angel could see
the dapper Frenchman following them out.</p>

<p>They stepped out along Shaftesbury Avenue;
then Jimmy stopped and fumbled in his pocket.
In his search he turned round, facing the direction
from which he had come. The dapper Frenchman
was sauntering toward him, whilst behind
him came two roughly-dressed men. Then
Jimmy saw the two men quicken their pace.
Passing one on each side of Callvet, each took an
arm affectionately, and the three turned into
Rupert Street, Angel and Jimmy following.</p>

<p>Jimmy saw the three bunched together, and
heard the click of the handcuffs. Then Angel
whistled a passing cab. The captive’s voice rose.
“Stick a handkerchief in his mouth,” said Angel,
and one of the men obeyed. The two stood
watching the cab till it turned the corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>“There is no sense in taking unnecessary
risks,” said Angel cheerfully. “It is one thing
being a fool, and another being a silly fool. Now
we’ll go along and see what else happens.”</p>

<p>He explained as he proceeded—</p>

<p>“I’ve wanted Callvet for quite a long time—he’s
on the list, so to speak. I lost sight of him
a year ago. How Spedding got him is a mystery.
If the truth be told, he’s got a nodding acquaintance
with half the crooks in London ... had
a big criminal practice before he went into the
more lucrative side of the law.”</p>

<p>A big crowd had gathered at the corner
of the Haymarket, and with one accord they
avoided it.</p>

<p>“Curiosity,” Angel prattled on, “has been the
undoing of many a poor soul. Keep away from
crowds, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>They walked on till they came to Angel’s flat in
Jermyn Street.</p>

<p>“Spedding will duplicate and triplicate his
schemes for catching us to-night,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>“He will,” agreed Angel, and opened the door
of the house in which his rooms were.</p>

<p>The narrow passageway, in which a light
usually burned day and night, was in darkness.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Angel, stepping back into the
street, “oh, indeed no!”</p>

<p>During their walk Jimmy had had a suspicion
that they had been followed. This suspicion was
confirmed when Angel whistled, and two men
crossed the road and joined them.</p>

<p>“Lend me your lamp, Johnson,” said Angel,
and taking the bright little electric lamp in his
hand, he entered the passage, followed by the
others. They reached the foot of the stairs, then
Angel reached back his hand without a word, and
one of the two men placed therein a stick. Cautiously
the party advanced up the stairway that
led to Angel’s room.</p>

<p>“Somebody has been here,” said Angel, and
pointed to a patch of mud on the carpet. The
door was ajar, and Jimmy sent it open with a
kick; then Angel put his arm cautiously into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
room and turned on the light, and the party
waited in the darkness for a movement.</p>

<p>There was no sign, and they entered. It did
not require any great ingenuity to see that the
place had been visited. Half-opened drawers,
their contents thrown on the floor, and all the
evidence of a hurried search met their eyes.</p>

<p>They passed from the little sitting-room to the
bedroom, and here again the visitors had left
traces of their investigations.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” Jimmy stopped and picked up a
soft felt hat. He looked inside; the dull lining
bore the name of an Egyptian hatter.</p>

<p>“Connor’s!” he said.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Angel softly, “so Connor takes
a hand, does he?”</p>

<p>One of the detectives who had followed them
in grasped Angel’s arm.</p>

<p>“Look, sir!” he whispered.</p>

<p>Half-hidden by the heavy hangings of the window,
a man crouched in the shadow.</p>

<p>“Come out of that!” cried Angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>Then something in the man’s attitude arrested
his speech. He slipped forward and pulled back
the curtain.</p>

<p>“Connor!” he cried.</p>

<p>Connor it was indeed, stone dead, with a bullet
hole in the center of his forehead.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>OPENING THE SAFE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> four men stood in silence before the body.
Jimmy bent and touched the hand.</p>

<p>“Dead!” he said.</p>

<p>Angel made no reply, but switched on every
light in the room. Then he passed his hands
rapidly through the dead man’s pockets; the
things he found he passed to one of the other
detectives, who laid them on the table.</p>

<p>“A chisel, a jemmy, a center-bit, lamp, pistol,”
enumerated Angel. “It is not difficult to understand
why Connor came here; but who killed
him?”</p>

<p>He made a close inspection of the apartment.
The windows were intact and fastened, there were
no signs of a struggle. In the sitting-room there
were muddy footmarks, which might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
made by Connor or his murderer. In the center
of the room was a small table. During Angel’s
frequent absences from his lodgings he was in the
habit of locking his two rooms against his servants,
who did their cleaning under his eye. In
consequence, the polished surface of the little
table was covered with a fine layer of dust, save
in one place where there was a curious circular
clearing about eight inches in diameter. Angel
examined this with scrupulous care, gingerly
pulling the table to where the light would fall on
it with greater brilliance. The little circle from
whence the dust had disappeared interested him
more than anything else in the room.</p>

<p>“You will see that this is not touched,” he said
to one of the men; and then to the other, “You
had better go round to Vine Street and report
this—stay, I will go myself.”</p>

<p>As Jimmy and he stepped briskly in the direction
of the historic police station, Angel expressed
himself tersely.</p>

<p>“Connor came on his own to burgle; he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
surprised by a third party, who, thinking Connor
was myself, shot him.”</p>

<p>“That is how I read it,” said Jimmy. “But
why did Connor come?”</p>

<p>“I have been expecting Connor,” said Angel
quietly. “He was not the sort of man to be
cowed by the fear of arrest. He had got it into
his head that I had got the secret of the safe, and
he came to find out.”</p>

<p>Inside the station the inspector on duty saluted
him.</p>

<p>“We have one of your men inside,” he said
pleasantly, referring to the Frenchman; then,
noticing the grave faces of the two, he added,
“Is anything wrong, sir?”</p>

<p>Briefly enough the detective gave an account of
what had happened in Jermyn Street. He added
his instructions concerning the table, and left as
the inspector was summoning the divisional
surgeon.</p>

<p>“I wonder where we could find Spedding?”
asked Angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“I wonder where Spedding will find us?”
added Jimmy grimly.</p>

<p>Angel looked round in surprise.</p>

<p>“Losing your nerve?” he asked rudely.</p>

<p>“No,” said the cool young man by his side
slowly; “but somehow life seems more precious
than it was a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Fiddlesticks!” said Angel. “You’re in
love.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I am,” admitted Jimmy in a surprised
tone, as if the idea had never occurred to
him before.</p>

<p>Angel looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Ten o’clock,” he said; “time for all good
people to be in bed. Being myself of a vicious
disposition, and, moreover, desirous of washing
the taste of tragedy out of my mouth, I suggest
we walk steadily to a place of refreshment.”</p>

<p>“Angel,” said Jimmy, “I cannot help thinking
that you like to hear yourself talk.”</p>

<p>“I love it,” said Angel frankly.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>In a little underground bar in Leicester Square
they sat at a table listening to a little string band
worry through the overture to <i>Lohengrin</i>.</p>

<p>The crowded room suited their moods.
Jimmy, in his preoccupation, found the noise, the
babble of voices in many tongues, and the wail of
the struggling orchestra, soothing after the exciting
events of the past few hours. To Angel
the human element in the crowd formed relaxation.
The loud-speaking men with their flashy
jewelry, the painted women with their automatic
smiles, the sprinkling of keen-faced sharps he
recognized, they formed part of the pageant of
life—the life—as Angel saw it.</p>

<p>They sat sipping their wine until there came a
man who, glancing carelessly round the room,
made an imperceptible sign to Angel, and then,
as if having satisfied himself that the man he
was looking for was not present, left the room
again.</p>

<p>Angel and his companion followed.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Angel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“Spedding goes to the safe to-night,” said the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“The guard at the safe is permanently withdrawn
by Spedding’s order.”</p>

<p>“That I know,” said Angel. “It was withdrawn
the very night the ‘Borough Lot’ came.
On whose behalf is Spedding acting?”</p>

<p>“On behalf of Connor, who I understand is
one of the legatees.”</p>

<p>Angel whistled.</p>

<p>“Whew! Jimmy, this is to be the Grand
Finale.”</p>

<p>He appeared deep in thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“It will be necessary for Miss Kent to be present,”
he said after a while.</p>

<p>From a neighboring district messenger office he
got on by the telephone to a garage, and within
half an hour they were ringing the bell at Kathleen’s
modest little house.</p>

<p>The girl rose to greet them as they entered.
All sign of the last night’s fatigue had vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>“Yes,” she replied, “I have slept the greater
part of the day.”</p>

<p>Angel observed that she studiously kept her
eyes from Jimmy, and that that worthy was preternaturally
interested in a large seascape that
hung over the fireplace.</p>

<p>“This is the last occasion we shall be troubling
you at so late an hour,” said Angel, “but I am
afraid we shall want you with us to-night.”</p>

<p>“I will do whatever you wish,” she answered
simply. “You have been, both of you, most
kind.”</p>

<p>She flashed a glance at Jimmy, and saw for the
first time the surgical dressing on his head.</p>

<p>“You—you are not hurt?” she cried in alarm,
then checked herself.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Jimmy loudly, “nothing, I
assure you.”</p>

<p>He was in an unusual panic, and wished he had
not come.</p>

<p>“He tripped over a hearthrug and fell against
a marble mantelpiece,” lied Angel elaborately.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
“The marble has been in the possession of my
family for centuries, and is now badly, and I fear
irretrievably, damaged.”</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled, and his smile was infectious.</p>

<p>“A gross libel, Miss Kent,” he said, recovering
his nerve. “As a matter of fact——”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” interrupted Angel
impressively, “Jimmy was walking in his
sleep——”</p>

<p>“Be serious, Mr. Angel,” implored the girl,
who was now very concerned as she saw
the extent of Jimmy’s injury, and noticed
the dark shadows under his eyes. “Was it
Spedding?”</p>

<p>“It was,” said Angel promptly. “A little
attempt which proved a failure.”</p>

<p>Jimmy saw the concern in the girl’s eyes, and,
manlike, it cheered him.</p>

<p>“It is hardly worth talking about,” he said
hastily, “and I think we ought not to delay our
departure a second.”</p>

<p>“I will not keep you a moment longer than I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
can help,” she said, and left the room to dress
herself for the journey.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said Angel, as soon as she had gone,
“cross my hand with silver, pretty gentleman,
and I will tell your fortune.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk rot,” replied Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I can see a bright future, a dark lady with
big gray eyes, who——”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, shut up!” growled
Jimmy, very red; “she’s coming.”</p>

<p>They reached the Safe Deposit when the bells
of the city were chiming the half-hour after
eleven.</p>

<p>“Shall we go in?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Better not,” advised Angel. “If Spedding
knows we have a key it might spoil the whole
show.”</p>

<p>So the car slowly patrolled the narrow length
of Lombard Street, an object of professional
interest to the half-dozen plain-clothes policemen
who were on duty there.</p>

<p>They had three-quarters of an hour to wait,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
for midnight had rung out from the belfries long
before a big car came gliding into the thoroughfare
from its western end. It stopped with a
jerk before the Safe Deposit, and a top-hatted
figure alighted. As he did so, Angel’s car drew
up behind, and the three got down.</p>

<p>Spedding, professionally attired in a frock-coat
and silk hat, stood with one foot on the steps of
the building and his hand upon the key he had
fitted.</p>

<p>He evinced no surprise when he saw Angel,
and bowed slightly to the girl. Then he opened
the door and stepped inside, and Angel and his
party followed. He lit the vestibule, opened the
inner door, and walked into the darkened hall.</p>

<p>Again came the click of switches, and every
light in the great hall blazed.</p>

<p>The girl shivered a little as she looked up at
the safe, dominating and sinister, a monument of
ruin, a materialization of the dead regrets of a
thousand bygone gamblers. Solitary, alone,
aloof it rose, distinct from the magnificent building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
in which it stood—a granite mass set in fine
gold. Old Reale had possessed a good eye for
contrasts, and had truly foreseen how well would
the surrounding beauty of the noble hall emphasize
the grim reality of the ugly pedestal.</p>

<p>Spedding closed the door behind them, and
surveyed the party with a triumphant smile.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” he said in his smoothest tones,
“you have come too late.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid we have,” agreed Angel, and the
lawyer looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“I wrote you a letter,” he said. “Did you get
it?”</p>

<p>“I have not been home since this afternoon,”
said Angel, and he heard the lawyer’s little sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” Spedding went on, “that I have
to disappoint you all; but as you know, by the
terms of the will the fortunate person who discovers
the word which opens the safe must notify
me, claiming the right to apply the word on the
combination lock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“That is so,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“I have received such a notification from one
of the legatees—Mr. Connor,” the lawyer went
on, and drew from his pocket a paper, “and I
have his written authority to open the safe on his
behalf.”</p>

<p>He handed the paper to Angel, who examined
it and handed it back.</p>

<p>“It was signed to-day,” was all that he said.</p>

<p>“At two o’clock this afternoon,” said the
lawyer. “I now——”</p>

<p>“Before you go any further, Mr. Spedding,”
said Angel, “I might remind you that there is a
lady present, and that you have your hat
on.”</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons,” said the lawyer with a
sarcastic smile, and removed his hat. Angel
reached out his hand for it, and mechanically the
lawyer relinquished it.</p>

<p>Angel looked at the crown. The nap was
rubbed the wrong way, and was covered with
fine dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“If you desire to valet me,” said the lawyer,
“I have no objection.”</p>

<p>Angel made no reply, but placed the hat carefully
on the mosaic floor of the hall.</p>

<p>“If,” said the lawyer, “before I open the safe,
there is any question you would like to ask, or any
legitimate objection you would wish to raise, I
shall be happy to consider it.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“Or you?” addressing Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the laconic answer.</p>

<p>“Or Miss Kent perhaps——?”</p>

<p>Kathleen looked him straight in the face as she
answered coldly—</p>

<p>“I am prepared to abide by the action of my
friends.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing left for me to do,” said the
lawyer after the slightest pause, “but to carry
out Mr. Connor’s instructions.”</p>

<p>He walked to the foot of the steel stairway and
mounted. He stopped for breath half-way up.
He was on a little landing, and facing him was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
the polished block of granite that marked where
the ashes of old Reale reposed.</p>

<p class="center">Pulvis<br>
Cinis<br>
et<br>
Nihil</p>

<p>said the inscription. “‘Dust, cinders and nothing,’”
muttered the lawyer, “an apt rebuke to
one seeking the shadows of vanity.”</p>

<p>They watched him climb till he reached the
broad platform that fronted the safe door. Then
they saw him pull a paper from his pocket and
examine it. He looked at it carefully, then
twisted the dials cautiously till one by one the
desired letters came opposite the pointer. Then
he twisted the huge handle of the safe. He
twisted and pulled, but the steel door did not
move. They saw him stoop and examine the
dial again, and again he seized the handle with the
same result. A dozen times he went through the
same process, and a dozen times the unyielding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
door resisted his efforts. Then he came clattering
down the steps, and almost reeled across the
floor of the hall to the little group. His eyes
burnt with an unearthly light, his face was pallid,
and the perspiration lay thick upon his forehead.</p>

<p>“The word!” he gasped. “It’s the wrong
word.”</p>

<p>Angel did not answer him.</p>

<p>“I have tested it a dozen times,” cried the
lawyer, almost beside himself, “and it has
failed.”</p>

<p>“Shall I try?” asked Angel.</p>

<p>“No, no!” the man hissed. “By Heaven,
no! I will try again. One of the letters is
wrong; there are two meanings to some of the
symbols.”</p>

<p>He turned and remounted the stairs.</p>

<p>“The man is suffering,” said Jimmy in an
undertone.</p>

<p>“Let him suffer,” said Angel, a hard look in
his eyes. “He will suffer more before he atones
for his villainy. Look, he’s up again. Let the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
men in, Jimmy, he will find the word this time—and
take Miss Kent away as soon as the trouble
starts.”</p>

<p>The girl saw the sudden mask of hardness that
had come over Angel’s face, saw him slip off his
overcoat, and heard the creaking of boots in the
hall outside. The pleasant, flippant man of the
world was gone, and the remorseless police officer,
inscrutable as doom, had taken his place. It was
a new Angel she saw, and she drew closer to
Jimmy.</p>

<p>An exultant shout from the man at the safe
made her raise her eyes. With a flutter at her
heart, she saw the ponderous steel door swing
slowly open.</p>

<p>Then from the man came a cry that was like
the snarl of some wild beast.</p>

<p>“Empty!” he roared.</p>

<p>He stood stunned and dumb; then he flung himself
into the great steel room, and they heard
his voice reverberating hollowly. Again he came
to the platform holding in his hand a white envelope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
Blindly he blundered down the stairs
again, and they could hear his heavy breathing.</p>

<p>“Empty!” His grating voice rose to a
scream. “Nothing but this!” He held the envelope
out, then tore it open.</p>

<p>It contained only a few words—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Received on behalf of Miss Kathleen Kent
the contents of this safe.</p>

<p class="right">“(Signed) <span class="smcap">James Cavendish Stannard</span>, Bart.<br>
<span class="indentright"><span class="smcap">Christopher Angel</span>.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>Dazed and bewildered, the lawyer read the
paper, then looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>“So it was you,” he said.</p>

<p>Angel nodded curtly.</p>

<p>“You!” said Spedding again.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You have robbed the safe—you—a police
officer.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Angel, not removing his eyes from
the man. He motioned to Jimmy, and Jimmy,
with a whispered word to the girl, led her to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
door. Behind him, as he returned to Angel’s
side, came six plain-clothes officers.</p>

<p>“So you think you’ve got me, do you?”
breathed Spedding.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” said Angel, “I know.”</p>

<p>“If you know so much, do you know how near
to death you are?”</p>

<p>“That also I know,” said Angel’s even voice.
“I’m all the more certain of my danger since I
have seen your hat.”</p>

<p>The lawyer did not speak.</p>

<p>“I mean,” Angel went on calmly, “since I saw
the hat that you put down on a dusty table in my
chambers—when you murdered Connor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you found him, did you—I wondered,”
said Spedding without emotion. Then he heard
a faint metallic click, and leapt back with his hand
in his pocket.</p>

<p>But Jimmy’s pistol covered him.</p>

<p>He paused irresolutely for one moment; then
six men flung themselves upon him, and he went
to the ground fighting. Handcuffed, he rose, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
nonchalant self, with the full measure of his
failure apparent. He was once again the suave,
smooth man of old. Indeed, he laughed as he
faced Angel.</p>

<p>“A good end,” he said. “You are a much
smarter man than I thought you were. What is
the charge?”</p>

<p>“Murder,” said Angel.</p>

<p>“You will find a difficulty in proving it,” Spedding
answered coolly, “and as it is customary at
this stage of the proceedings for the accused to
make a conventional statement, I formally declare
that I have not seen Connor for two days.”</p>

<p>Closely guarded, he walked to the door. He
passed Kathleen standing in the vestibule, and
she shrank on one side, which amused him. He
clambered into the car that had brought him,
followed by the policemen, and hummed a little
tune.</p>

<p>He leaned over to say a final word to Angel.</p>

<p>“You think I am indecently cheerful,” he said,
“but I feel as a man wearied with folly, who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
the knowledge that before him lies the sound
sleep that will bring forgetfulness.”</p>

<p>Then, as the car was moving off, he spoke
again—</p>

<p>“Of course I killed Connor—it was inevitable.”</p>

<p>And then the car carried him away.</p>

<p>Angel locked the door of the deposit, and
handed the key to Kathleen.</p>

<p>“I will ask Jimmy to take you home,” he said.</p>

<p>“What do you think of him?” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Spedding? Oh, he’s acted as I thought he
would. He represents the very worst type of
criminal in the world; you cannot condemn, any
more than you can explain, such men as that.
They are in a class by themselves—Nature’s perversities.
There is a side to Spedding that is
particularly pleasant.”</p>

<p>He saw the two off, then walked slowly to the
City Police Station. The inspector on duty
nodded to him as he entered.</p>

<p>“We have put him in a special cell,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>“Has he been well searched?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The usual kit, and a revolver
loaded in five chambers.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it,” said Angel.</p>

<p>He took the pistol under the gaslight. One
chamber contained an empty shell, and the barrel
was foul. That will hang him without his confession,
he thought.</p>

<p>“He asked for a pencil and paper,” said the
inspector, “but he surely does not expect bail.”</p>

<p>Angel shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, I should imagine he wants to write to
me.”</p>

<p>A door burst open, and a bareheaded jailer
rushed in.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong in No. 4,” he said,
and Angel followed the inspector as he ran down
the narrow corridor, studded with iron doors on
either side.</p>

<p>The inspector took one glance through the spy-hole.</p>

<p>“Open the door!” he said quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>With a jangle and rattle of bolts, the door was
opened. Spedding lay on his back, with a faint
smile on his lips; his eyes were closed, and Angel,
thrusting his hand into the breast of the stricken
man, felt no beat of the heart.</p>

<p>“Run for a doctor!” said the inspector.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” said Angel quietly, “the man’s
dead.”</p>

<p>On the rough bed lay a piece of paper. It was
addressed in the lawyer’s bold hand to Angel
Esquire.</p>

<p>The detective picked it up and read it.</p>

<p>“Excellent Angel,” the letter ran, “the time
has come when I must prove for myself the vexed
question of immortality. I would say that I bear
you no ill will, nor your companion, nor the
charming Miss Kent. I would have killed you all,
or either, of course, but happily my intentions
have not coincided with my opportunities. For
some time past I have foreseen the possibility of
my present act, and have worn on every suit one
button, which, colored to resemble its fellows, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
in reality a skilfully molded pellet of cyanide.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>Angel looked down at the dead man at his feet.
The top cloth-covered button on the right breast
had been torn away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE SOLUTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you can understand that all the extraordinary
events of the previous chapters occurred
without the knowledge of Fleet Street, that eminent
journalists went about their business day by
day without being any the wiser, that eager news
editors were diligently searching the files of the
provincial press for news items, with the mystery
of the safe at their very door, and that reporters
all over London were wasting their time over
wretched little motor-bus accidents and gas explosions,
you will all the easier appreciate the
journalistic explosion that followed the double
inquest on Spedding and his victim.</p>

<p>It is outside the province of this story to instruct
the reader in what is so much technical
detail, but it may be said in passing that no less
than twelve reporters, three sub-editors, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
“crime experts,” and one publisher were summarily
and incontinently discharged from their
various newspapers in connection with the “Safe
Story.” The <i>Megaphone</i> alone lost five men, but
then the <i>Megaphone</i> invariably discharges more
than any other paper, because it has got a reputation
to sustain. Flaring contents bills, heavy
black headlines, and column upon column of solid
type, told the story of Reale’s millions, and the
villainous lawyer, and the remarkable verse, and
the “Borough Lot.” There were portraits of
Angel and portraits of Jimmy and portraits of
Kathleen (sketched in court and accordingly repulsive),
and plans of the lawyer’s house at Clapham
and sketches of the Safe Deposit.</p>

<p>So for the three days that the coroner’s inquiry
lasted London, and Fleet Street more especially,
reveled in the story of the old croupier’s remarkable
will and its tragic consequences. The Crown
solicitors very tactfully skimmed over Jimmy’s
adventurous past, were brief in their examination
of Kathleen; but Angel’s interrogation lasted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
greater part of five hours, for upon him devolved
the task of telling the story in full.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Angel’s evidence was
a remarkably successful effort to justify all that
Scotland Yard had done. There were certain irregularities
to be glossed over, topics to be
avoided—why, for instance, official action was
not taken when it was seen that Spedding contemplated
a felony. Most worthily did Angel hold
the fort for officialdom that day, and when he
vacated the box he left behind him the impression
that Scotland Yard was all foreseeing, all wise,
and had added yet another to its list of successful
cases.</p>

<p>The newspaper excitement lasted exactly four
days. On the fourth day, speaking at the Annual
Congress of the British Association, Sir William
Farran, that great physician, in the course of an
illuminating address on “The first causes of disease,”
announced as his firm conviction that all
the ills that flesh is heir to arise primarily from
the wearing of boots, and the excitement that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
followed the appearance in Cheapside of a converted
Lord Mayor with bare feet will long be
remembered in the history of British journalism.
It was enough, at any rate, to blot out the memory
of the Reale case, for immediately following the
vision of a stout and respected member of the
Haberdasher Company in full robes and chain of
office entering the Mansion House insufficiently
clad there arose that memorable newspaper discussion
“Boots and Crime,” which threatened at
one time to shake established society to its very
foundations.</p>

<p>“Bill is a brick,” wrote Angel to Jimmy. “I
suggested to him that he might make a sensational
statement about microbes, but he said that the
<i>Lancet</i> had worked bugs to death, and offered the
‘no boots’ alternative.”</p>

<p>It was a fortnight after the inquiry that Jimmy
drove to Streatham to carry out his promise to
explain to Kathleen the solution of the cryptogram.</p>

<p>It was his last visit to her, that much he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>
decided. His rejection of her offer to equally
share old Reale’s fortune left but one course open
to him, and that he elected to take.</p>

<p>She expected him, and he found her sitting
before a cozy fire idly turning the leaves of a
book.</p>

<p>Jimmy stood for a moment in an embarrassed
silence. It was the first time he had been alone
with her, save the night he drove with her to
Streatham, and he was a little at a loss for an
opening.</p>

<p>He began conventionally enough speaking
about the weather, and not to be outdone in commonplace,
she ordered tea.</p>

<p>“And now, Miss Kent,” he said, “I have got
to explain to you the solution of old Reale’s
cryptogram.”</p>

<p>He took a sheet of paper from his pocket covered
with hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>“Where old Reale got his idea of the cryptogram
from was, of course, Egypt. He lived
there long enough to be fairly well acquainted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
with the picture letters that abound in that country,
and we were fools not to jump at the solution
at first. I don’t mean you,” he added hastily.
“I mean Angel and I and Connor, and all the
people who were associated with him.”</p>

<p>The girl was looking at the sheet, and smiled
quietly at the <i>faux pas</i>.</p>

<p>“How he came into touch with the ‘professor——’”</p>

<p>“What has happened to that poor old man?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Angel has got him into some kind of institute,”
replied Jimmy. “He’s a fairly common
type of cranky old gentleman. ‘A science potterer,’
Angel calls him, and that is about the description.
He’s the sort of man that haunts the
Admiralty with plans for unsinkable battleships, a
‘minus genius’—that’s Angel’s description too—who,
with an academic knowledge and a good
memory, produced a reasonably clever little book,
that five hundred other schoolmasters might just
as easily have written. How the professor came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
into Reale’s life we shall never know. Probably
he came across the book and discovered the
author, and trusting to his madness, made a confidant
of him. Do you remember,” Jimmy went
on, “that you said the figures reminded you of
the Bible? Well, you are right. Almost every
teacher’s Bible, I find, has a plate showing how
the alphabet came into existence.”</p>

<p>He indicated with his finger as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Here is the Egyptian hieroglyphic. Here is
a ‘hand’ that means ‘D,’ and here is the queer
little Hieratic wiggle that means the same thing,
and you see how the Phœnician letter is very little
different to the hieroglyphic, and the Greek
‘delta’ has become a triangle, and locally it has
become the ‘D’ we know.” He sketched rapidly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_312.jpg" alt="hieroglyph"></div>

<p>“All this is horribly learned,” he said, “and
has got nothing to do with the solution. But old
Reale went through the strange birds, beasts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
and things till he found six letters, S P R I N G,
which were to form the word that would open
the safe.”</p>

<p>“It is very interesting,” she said, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>“The night you were taken away,” said
Jimmy, “we found the word and cleared out the
safe in case of accidents. It was a very risky
proceeding on our part, because we had no authority
from you to act on your behalf.”</p>

<p>“You did right,” she said. She felt it was a
feeble rejoinder, but she could think of nothing
better.</p>

<p>“And that is all,” he ended abruptly, and
looked at the clock.</p>

<p>“You must have some tea before you go,” she
said hurriedly.</p>

<p>They heard the weird shriek of a motor-horn
outside, and Jimmy smiled.</p>

<p>“That is Angel’s newest discovery,” he said,
not knowing whether to bless or curse his energetic
friend for spoiling the <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>“Oh!” said the girl, a little blankly he
thought.</p>

<p>“Angel is always experimenting with new
noises,” said Jimmy, “and some fellow has introduced
him to a motor-siren which is claimed to
possess an almost human voice.”</p>

<p>The bell tinkled, and a few seconds after Angel
was ushered into the room.</p>

<p>“I have only come for a few minutes,” he said
cheerfully. “I wanted to see Jimmy before he
sailed, and as I have been called out of town
unexpectedly——”</p>

<p>“Before he sails?” she repeated slowly. “Are
you going away?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he’s going away,” said Angel, avoiding
Jimmy’s scowling eyes. “I thought he would
have told you.”</p>

<p>“I——” began Jimmy.</p>

<p>“He’s going into the French Congo to shoot
elephants,” Angel rattled on; “though what the
poor elephants have done to him I have yet to
discover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>“But this is sudden?”</p>

<p>She was busy with the tea-things, and had her
back toward them, so Jimmy did not see her hand
tremble.</p>

<p>“You’re spilling the milk,” said the interfering
Angel. “Shall I help you?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” she replied tartly.</p>

<p>“This tea is delicious,” said Angel, unabashed,
as he took his cup. He had come to perform a
duty, and he was going through with it. “You
won’t get afternoon tea on the Sangar River,
Jimmy. I know because I have been there, and
I wouldn’t go again, not even if they made me
governor of the province.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked, with a futile attempt to
appear indifferent.</p>

<p>“Please take no notice of Angel, Miss Kent,”
implored Jimmy, and added malevolently, “Angel
is a big game shot, you know, and he is anxious
to impress you with the extent and dangers of his
travels.”</p>

<p>“That is so,” agreed Angel contentedly, “but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
all the same, Miss Kent, I must stand by what I
said in regard to the ‘Frongo.’ It’s a deadly
country, full of fever. I’ve known chaps to complain
of a headache at four o’clock and be dead
by ten, and Jimmy knows it too.”</p>

<p>“You are very depressing to-day, Mr. Angel,”
said the girl. She felt unaccountably shaky, and
tried to tell herself that it was because she had not
recovered from the effects of her recent exciting
experiences.</p>

<p>“I was with a party once on the Sangar River,”
Angel said, cocking a reflective eye at the ceiling.
“We were looking for elephants, too, a terribly
dangerous business. I’ve known a bull elephant
charge a hunter and——”</p>

<p>“Angel!” stormed Jimmy, “will you be kind
enough to reserve your reminiscences for another
occasion?”</p>

<p>Angel rose and put down his teacup sadly.</p>

<p>“Ah, well!” he sighed lugubriously, “after
all, life is a burden, and one might as well die in
the French Congo—a particularly lonely place to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
die in, I admit—as anywhere else. Good-by,
Jimmy.” He held out his hand mournfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goat!” entreated Jimmy. “I will
let you know from time to time how I am; you
can send your letters via Sierra Leone.”</p>

<p>“The White Man’s Grave!” murmured Angel
audibly.</p>

<p>“And I’ll let you know in plenty of time when
I return.”</p>

<p>“When!” said Angel significantly. He shook
hands limply, and with the air of a man taking an
eternal farewell. Then he left the room, and they
could hear the eerie whine of his patent siren
growing fainter and fainter.</p>

<p>“Confound that chap!” said Jimmy. “With
his glum face and extravagant gloom he——”</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell me you were going?”
she asked him quietly. She stood with a neat
foot on the fender and her head a little bent.</p>

<p>“I had come to tell you,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Why are you going?”</p>

<p>Jimmy cleared his throat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“Because I need the change,” he said almost
brusquely.</p>

<p>“Are you tired—of your friends?” she asked,
not lifting her eyes.</p>

<p>“I have so few friends,” said Jimmy bitterly.
“People here who are worth knowing know
me.”</p>

<p>“What do they know?” she asked, and looked
at him.</p>

<p>“They know my life,” he said doggedly,
“from the day I was sent down from Oxford to
the day I succeeded to my uncle’s title and estates.
They know I have been all over the world picking
up strange acquaintances. They know I was one
of the”—he hesitated for a word—“gang that
robbed Rahbat Pasha’s bank; that I held a big
share in Reale’s ventures—a share he robbed me
of, but let that pass; that my life has been consistently
employed in evading the law.”</p>

<p>“For whose benefit?” she asked.</p>

<p>“God knows,” he said wearily, “not for mine.
I have never felt the need of money, my uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
saw to that. I should never have seen Reale
again but for a desire to get justice. If you think
I have robbed for gain, you are mistaken. I have
robbed for the game’s sake, for the excitement
of it, for the constant fight of wits against men
as keen as myself. Men like Angel made me a
thief.”</p>

<p>“And now——?” she asked.</p>

<p>“And now,” he said, straightening himself up,
“I am done with the old life. I am sick and
sorry—and finished.”</p>

<p>“And is this African trip part of your scheme
of penitence?” she asked. “Or are you going
away because you want to forget——”</p>

<p>Her voice had sunk almost to a whisper, and
her eyes were looking into the fire.</p>

<p>“What?” he asked huskily.</p>

<p>“To forget—me,” she breathed.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said, “that is what I want to
forget.”</p>

<p>“Why?” she said, not looking at him.</p>

<p>“Because—oh, because I love you too much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
dear, to want to drag you down to my level. I
love you more than I thought it possible to love a
woman—so much, that I am happy to sacrifice the
dearest wish of my heart, because I think I will
serve you better by leaving you.”</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it between his two
strong hands.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” she whispered, so that he
had to bend closer to hear what she said, “don’t
you think I—I ought to be consulted?”</p>

<p>“You—you,” he cried in wonderment, “would
you——”</p>

<p>She looked at him with a smile, and her eyes
were radiant with unspoken happiness.</p>

<p>“I want you, Jimmy,” she said. It was the
first time she had called him by name. “I want
you, dear.”</p>

<p>His arms were about her, and her lips met his.</p>

<p>They did not hear the tinkle of the bell, but
they heard the knock at the door, and the girl
slipped from his arms and was collecting the tea-things
when Angel walked in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>He looked at Jimmy inanely, fiddling with his
watch chain, and he looked at the girl.</p>

<p>“Awfully sorry to intrude again,” he said,
“but I got a wire at the little postoffice up the
road telling me I needn’t take the case at Newcastle,
so I thought I’d come back and tell you,
Jimmy, that I will take what I might call a ‘cemetery
drink’ with you to-night.”</p>

<p>“I am not going,” said Jimmy, recovering his
calm.</p>

<p>“Not—not going?” said the astonished Angel.</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl, speaking over his shoulder,
“I have persuaded him to stay.”</p>

<p>“Ah, so I see!” said Angel, stooping to pick
up two hairpins that lay on the hearthrug.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It was impossible for Lord
Grandminster, Prime Minister of
England, to believe, at first that
London could be destroyed in a
terrible and unknown manner if
the fabulous sum of money, demanded
by the men who boasted
they were the possessors of a new
Force which was mighty enough
to wreck the world, was not delivered
before a set date. The
ransom was not paid and the first
blow of “The Dictators” was
struck. Charing Cross was leveled
to the ground in a manner that
left no doubt of the powers of
the pitiless, unknown Dictators.
Three days of looting and terror
followed in the city; days filled
with maddening suspense for the
ministry that had disregarded the
ultimatum—a suspense that was
only ended when the steamer
Malvolio was sunk in the North
Sea.</p>
